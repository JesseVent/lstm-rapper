oh yeah this is eminem baby back up in that motherfucking ass
one time for your mother fucking mind we represent the 313
you know what im saying cause they dont know shit about this
to get your brain relaxing a zany acting maniac in action
you look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run
i travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
im sliming grills of roaches with sprayed on disinfectants
twist the necks of rappers til their spinal column disconnects
we disinfect then check the monologue turn your system up
this is the season for noise pollution contamination
hits a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation
when i declare invasion there aint no time to be stare and gazing
i went to it serving a sentence for murderin instruments
but when i hear the beat im tempted to make another attempt at it
bust it i let the beat commence so i can beat the sense of your elite defense
i got some meat to mince a crew to stomp and two feet to rinse
i foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
one thought in my cerebral is deeper then a jeep full of people
battle a band of phony mcs and stand the lonely one
imitator intimidator stimulator simulator of data eliminator
theres never been a greater since the burial of jesus
my accapella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
and eases you mentally gently sentimentally instrumentally
man i got evidence im never dense and i been clever ever since
my residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the mo
cause theres a monster will in me that always wants to kill mcs
i get cynical act a fool then i send a crew back to school
i never packed a tool or acted cool it wasnt practical
id rather let a tactical tact full track tickle your fancy
a man who aint a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
this is for my family the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
be all you can be cause once you make an instant hit
im tensed a bit and tempted when i see the sins my friends commit
yeah soul intent checking it number one baby this week
ay yo we got the number one requested song of the day coming up next
im up all night but everything is alright its alright
its a rough week and i dont get enough sleep i cant sleep
its a long year pretending i belong here belong here
its a rough week and i dont get enough sleep i cant sleep
its a long year pretending i belong here belong here
i wanna grow to be so old that i have to be carried
and have at least a half a million for my baby girl
cause im still struggling hard to be the man and its tough
cause man its been rough but still i manage enough
or plan to give up the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
im anteing up double or nothing ive been trouble enough
my destinys to rest at ease till im impressed and pleased
with my progress i wont settle for less than cheese
to know i hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
where they dont pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf q
im going for broke gambling and playing for keeps
everyday in the streets scrambling and paying for cheep
wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
ive seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
but in the mist of this insanity i found my christianity
and hope for the best instead of mope and depressed
my little brothers trying to learn his mathematics
hes asthmatic running home from school away from crack addicts
taking target practice on teens for starter jackets
its cumbersome im trying to do well on this earth
but its been hell on this earth since i fell on this earth
uh its ok yeah its alright even though i cant sleep
if you ever wanna be one see man what you know about a sweet mc in the 313
im the freshest whack mc that you ever heard in your lifetime
boy im the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
forgot a gold diggers succubus  my souls thick with ruggedness
with the mic im like a dyke cant no nigga fuck with this
on open mic i bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming bitch
let it be that i stated they hate it now that they see that i made it
if rap was a dick all you so called hard mcs would not be impitant
but pimping it and acting like you could rock a show so
harder than lls rock the bells but you is a ho now
my rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
at a faster rate yeah i got something for your ass to hate
i blasterate and have you all running master gates
i got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
bucking these hoes i got that shit down to a science
leaving them hot and bothered turned on like an appliance
i drop beats and you aint singing or gonna do a thing about
that you couldnt hold your own with the strength of lou forigno
yo you need to come with the real skills and act like you know
if you ever wanna be one see now what you know about a sweet mc from the 313
im sure your bound to agree a sweet mc crashes the spot
ill make the roof hot like i was rock master scott
your ass forgot so just in case you dont remember me
ill run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
you will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
ill send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
he better come cleaner then jay rue jacking off when he showers
you could date a stick of dynamite and wouldnt go out with a bang
so facts are known writers get treated with shocks
i rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
im greeted with flocks of fellow followers singers
you couldnt make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their
but dont front and never try to be what youre not
cause you can be quick jump the candlestick burn your back
and fuck jill on a hill but you still aint jack
druggling thugs smuggling drugs juggling jobs guzzling jugs
we travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
the tall shit that will end up with his skull split
butterfingers is here and its necessary to scratch it
tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight blends in with lyrics
we dont wanna fight we dont want no one feeling uptight
till the morning light hope that everyones feeling alright
till the morning light hope that everyones feeling alright
but i can handle this im the rhyme biter crime fighter
caped crusader taking care of undeserving lime lighters
experimentally i found a way to spread interamentally
by using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
talking that junk like you went black guarded your back
come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
when i rap i represent it and will never referee in it
im forever demented come up with funk ill never be scented
for those who thought that i would make you bored and treat you like a piece
i rap for all you draculas and showed you all how whack you was
i meant it as a dis cause you dont posses the pizzazz as this
who fails to recognize my reign of hell rule to the sire
theres no one whos identical to my fresh and authentic flow
and let them know the only party that was phat was here just be like
maxine phone rings hello can i speak to maxine yeah this is me whats up what up who dis denaun yeah whats up what are you doing nothing just laying in bed huh nothing just laying in bed why i dont know thinking about something freaky to do
she tests positive but tells you that her acts clean
asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
youre in jepordation if you aint got no preparation
if you match the price otherwise she wont look at you twice
dont bring your germs to me cause i aint trying to hear it
while your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it maxine
sometimes i wonder whats your purpose in life that is
to get with every brother and unveil one of his kids shit
you living trife got three kids at home and club hopping every night
and then speeds back to a regular pace there is no end to this
you say you wanna be with me but how can you say that
i refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely
i met this girl last week she was a freak and she liked me
and chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
big game over there and take notes while i get this number
i stepped to her first i cleared my throat and said hey bitch
she started crying and asked me to forgive her and shit
she said her name was maxine so i told her i wanted her number
we got into a good conversation thats when she asked me could i fuck
give me your address ill be through and youll find out
she didnt waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
i said hold up and stop proceeding you rushing things
so i went for my protection took off my clothes and started flexing

ill make the tea hot people get in my face and ask
if i wanna battle then i chase them in a jason mask
invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
wicked wizardry like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
when i torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
slicing up an enemys appendages till he hemorrhages
and when hes through with his verse im all covered in flea bites
you couldnt flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula
you wanna feel the full effect of me hand a tech to me
intellectually superior ill make the whack wearier
bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache whither and break

severing flesh of fools who never impressed i can confess

yo we got to get the money man i cant be broke for the rest of my life
look theres got to be something better you know what im saying

yo im not about to chance it and dismiss handling business
the few that i trust thems the people that i still got
we just wanted to be funded and live to be a hundred
thats what im talking about im not trying to be the player
yo forgot that president man im trying to be king
getting money anytime i want owning my own businesses and all that
yeah im trying to be a millionare man hahaha but dont all you know
i been searching but your the one i want in my life baby
im reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
missing what i remember kissing and hugging and squeezing
bugging and weezing im having trouble when breathing
but theres a couple of reasons that im suffering and grieving
for loving and leaving you all im thinking of in the evening
thoughts of nothing but freaking that im struggling to keep in
you got your hair in a bun no matter what youre wearing you stun
cause your comparing to none i wanna share in the fun
i feel a passionate lust when im imagining just us alone at last with a
i see you grasping to trust but my intentions are good
i just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
if you agree to repeat after me i love you i love you baby
cause i just need you to see how much im eager to be
if you care to be down cause aint nobody like you no where to be found
well take a spin in a lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
if daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
its still all right cause i got minute maid and tangeray
your an incredible one thats rare in bed with edible underwear
i dream of freaking you the women that will speak it too so
it seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
when you step away baby but dont forget the neglicie
i been searching but your the one i want in my life baby
we have an all points bulletin out on a man with green hair
hes armed with a knife i repeat hes armed with a knife
theres a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
hell stab you with a sword dont be fooled by his charm
good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks
hit a bitch snake from the back i make you think youre a backstabber
locking down every block and put up metal detectors
watch each others backs and guard your command post
he could be disguised as one of your very own guys
i followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
i taste lint in my mouth then the lights in the place went
dealing with backstabbers there was one thing i learned
theyre only powerful when you got your back turned
i took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
hes going back to the crazy home how about that
jealous what he mean jealous know what im saying
he just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes know what im saying
girls dont buy him no clothes he bought that ho some clothes
he dont buy me no clothes nigga aint got no money no vibe no dick
he aint gonna make it no where he aint got no type of time
i come home every single day from working double shifts
and stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
i come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
it must be only just because you never learned to trust me
i bring you diamond rings you say im bad at timing things
so whats a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
you act to be this gangsta bitch that aint what first attracted me
i used to love your company now you always bugging me
for information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
see ive never been so sure and your just insecure
look at the nervous wreck im in i need my second wind say what
fuck eminem he just mad cause i left that nigga for another man
me and eminem dont need nothing but my and his money
immature me nigga aint got no dick no swang in his thang
know what im saying he just mad cause im getting it all night
jealous of me know what im saying thats what im talking about
i used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
and tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
it made complete sense theres someone else you like
and you was like sampled i need a new nigga
leaving me in sorrow brandy never felt so broken hearted
i fell apart when you departed then the joking started
and i became the laughing stock but now im on my feet again
he goes you didnt want me to see you then i dont want you now
take a towel wipe your brow quit trying to hunt me down
for all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
because i got a bigger wallet size you wanna swing it
look in the mirror youre nothing youre nothing without me
you see this bullet hole in my neck its self inflicted
cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
use to let the babysitter suck my dick when i was littleer
didnt ya bring your bitch i wanna see if this dick gon fit in her im low down and im shiftee
and if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
and ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
with a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
but i was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
so what im on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
went up inside the first national bank broke and left rich
you just lost your tip theres a pubic hair in my breakfast
get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mamas chapped lips
beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
im just joking is dirty dozens really dust smoking
if all your shits missing than probably one of us broke in
my heads ringing like it was spider sense tingling
lit it like green bay did when they shitted on new england
make your mama be like ohh this is good who sing this
its rugged but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit
pathetic but i dont think this headaches ever vanishing
panicing i think i might have just took too much anasin
they say thats where it ends the closest they gon come is tupac
its gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
but they really your enemies with secret indentities
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin
im tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
tired of always giving in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and minithins
im tired of this dj playing your shit when he spins
tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo
im tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
im tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
im tired of being fired everytime i fart and cough
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand id make the world suck my dick
i would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
im tired of being white trash broke and always poor
tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
tired of not having a home to have one in if i did have it on
tired of not working at gm tired of wanting to be him
tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of lugz
tired of people saying theyre tired of hearing me rap about drugs
tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasnt feeling me on nobodys as ill as me
howm i sposed to be positive when i dont see shit positive
know what im sayin right now im tired of everything
tired of all this player hating thats going on in my own city
a get your hands in the air and get to clapping em
cursing at you players worse than marty schottenheimer
you wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
you aint gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
im doing acid crack smack coke and smoking dope then
my name is marshall mathers im an alcoholic hi marshall
i have a disease and they dont know what to call it
better hide your wallet cause im coming up quick to strip your cash
bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
bitch im coming out swinging so fast itll make your eyes spin
the proof is in the pudding just ask the deshaun holton
ill slit your motherfucking throat worse than ron goldman
im nicer than pete but im on a search to crush a milkbone
im ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
im colder than snow season when its twenty below freezing
flavor with no seasoning this is the sneak preview
ill diss your magazine and still wont get a weak review
ill make your freak leave you smell the folgers crystals
this is a lyrical combat gentlemen hold your pistols
but i form like voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
somebody let me out this limousine hey let me out
im a caged demon on stage screaming like rage against the machine
im convinced im a fiend shooting up while this record is spinning
clinically brain dead i dont need a second opinion
fuck dropping the jewel im flipping the sacred treasure
ill bite your motherfucking style just to make it fresher
sick of nagging bosses bitching while im washing dishes
in school i never said much too busy having a headrush
doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
then i went to jim beam thats when my face grayed
went to gym in eighth grade raped the womens swim team
too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smoking weed again

an eighth grader who acted obnoxious cause his father boxes
and had me in the position to beat me into submission
he banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose
soaked my clothes in blood grabbed me and choked my throat
but he just wouldnt leave he kept chokin me and i couldnt breathe
holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
then i got up and ran to the janitors storage booth
kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
grabbed some sharp objects brooms and foreign tools
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could
and beat him over the head with it til i broke the wood
started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray
my mother started screamin what are you on drugs
look at you youre gettin blood all over my rug sorry
opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
i picked it up and screamed look bitch what have you done oh my god im sorry son shut up you cunt i said fuck it
then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

i deserve respect but i work a sweat for this worthless check
bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt
watching ballers while theyre flossing in their pathfinders
we all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
along with the small frys and average half pinters
while player haters turn bitch like they have vaginas
cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
cause youre mad enough to scream but youre sad enough to tear
and im sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
and im tired of being hired and fired the same day
but fuck it if you know the rules to the game play
cause when we die we know were all going the same way
its cool to be the player but it sucks to be the fan
and yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
my daughter wants to throw the ball but im too stressed to play
theres people that love me and people that hate me yup
but its the evil that made me this backstabbing deceitful and shady
i want the money the women the fortune and the fame
that means ill end up burning in hell scorching in flames
that means im stealing your checkbook and forging your name
theres lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
cause right now i feel like ive just hit the rock bottom
i got problems now everybody on my blocks got em im done
im screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot em
holding two glocks i hope your doors got new locks on em
my daughters feet aint got no shoes or socks on em

i got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want em
 skylar montgomery what do you want from me roger i know it was you all along messing around with my dear veronica wait a minute you hold it right there

they never shouldve booted me out of reform school
i said it wasnt me i got a twin oh my god its you not again

slappin teachers and jacking off in front of my counselors
hell never last the only class hell pass is phys ed
that she was too fat to swim laps she needed slim fast who me
yeah bitch you so big you walked into big tannys and stepped on jenny craig
put me in the headlock then i thought of my guinea pig
i felt the evilness and started transforming rarrrr
it began storming i heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
and took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
while i drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop
while little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
dressed like a sailor standing by a pale of garbage
its almost dark and im still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
id like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza
but im broke as fuck and i dont get paid till the first of next month
but if you care to join me i was bout to roll this next blunt
cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me
wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
then slid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine
all i wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
and seen her spread across the bed naked watching gay porn
i turned around to run twisted my ankle and sprained it
she came at me at full speed nothing could stop her
i shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
but she swallowed my fucking leg whole like an egg roll
i grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
just trying to buy me some time then i remembered this magic trick
it hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death ah ah
we all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
these are the things that surround us through our atmosphere

twenty years ago two outlaws took this whole town over
that old saloon there was their little home away from home
they say the ghosts of bad and evil still live in that tavern
you can still hear the footsteps of slim shady and royce da 59
i dont speak i float in the air wrapped in a sheet
im not a real person im a ghost trapped in a beat
i translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
and a noise is spread picked up and transmitted through royces head
trap him in his room possess him and hoist his bed
til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
we can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto
intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
in my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
and stay overworked its like the nazis and the nation
and we hit the trees til we look like vietnamese people
above the law cause i dont agree with police either shit me neither
so please leave me with the keys to your jeep eagle
while i stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
no im not i just want to shoot up and im pissed off
and survive long enough to kill my soul after im dead
when in danger its funny actually my flavors similar to a waiter
while slipping bullets at pointblank range like they was punches
piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral
with my fists wrapped in gauze dipped in glue and glass
to cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt

fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
children id like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
while mr kaniff is out with pneumonia hes got aids
but first id like you to meet my friend bob huh
say hi bob hi bob bobs 30 and still lives with his mom
and he dont got a job cause bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his twelveyear old brother looks up to him an awful lot
and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock
when its late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
drag em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks ahh
the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge
when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
but bob wouldnt knock it off cause hes crazy and off his rocker
you couldnt even take him to dres to get bob a dr
he grabbed stace by the legs as chopped it off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner
so see if the squirrels want any  its bad for you
and if you dont believe me ask ya dahhhd ask him man
and if you dont believe him ask ya mom thats right
shell tell you how she does em all the time she will
then theres really nothin else to say sing along
my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it
fuck no you aint seen it its the size of a peanut huh
speakin of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels
kids two hitsll probably drain all your spinal fluid
so dont get attached itll attack every bone in your back
after hangin out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold
and decides to try five when hes bribed by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
suddenly he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
and his eyes roll back in his skull blblblblblb
his back starts tah  look like the mcdonalds arches
hes on donalds carpet layin horizontal barfin bleh
and everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him
so theyre laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like hes practicin yoga
so dont even feed that to squirrels class cause its bad for you
and if you dont believe me ask ya dahhhd thats right
so you dont act like everyone else does thats right
it grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe it off
bag it up and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
and sometimes you see things that arent there like what
women stick em up their behinds go out and wear em huh
ya tongue gets all swoll up like a cows tongue how come
but your mom and dad know thats all that im good at oh
but dont be me cause if you grow up and you go and od
theyre gonna come for me and ima have to grow a goatee
and get a disguise and hide cause itll be my fault
and if you dont believe me ask ya dahhhd put that down
and if you dont believe him ask ya mom you can ask
shell tell you how she does em all the time and she will
so you dont act like everyone else does like i do
and theres really nothin else to say thats right
drugs are just bad drugs are just bad south park is gonna sue me

touch so much anger aimed in no particular direction just sprays and sprays and straight
through your radio waves it plays and plays till it stays stuck in your head for days and
days who would of thought standing in this mirror bleachin my hair with some peroxide
reaching for a tshirt to wear that i would catapult to the forefront of rap like this how
could i predict my words would have an impact like this i mustve struck a chord with somebody

flipped when they knew i was produced by dre thats all it took and they were instantly hooked

keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
leave em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
see they can trigger me but theyll never figure me out
look at me now i bet ya probably sick of me now aint you mama
so before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
my faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i dont on second thought i just fucking wished he would die
i look at hailie and i couldnt picture leaving her side
to make it work with her at least for hailies sake
but im only human but im man enough to face them today

cause ida killed him shit i wouldve shot kim and him both
its my life id like to welcome yall to the eminem show
now i would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
take a second to listen fore you think this record is dissing
but put yourself in my position just try to envision
witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
bitching that someones always going through her purse and shits missing
going through public housing systems victim of munchhausens syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasnt
til i grew up now i blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach
doesnt it wasnt it the reason you made that cd for me ma
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma
but guess what youre getting older now and its cold when youre lonely
and nathans growing up so quick hes gonna know that youre phony
and hailies getting so big now you should see her shes beautiful
but youll never see her  she wont even be at your funeral
see what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong
bitch do your song  keep telling yourself that you was a mom
but how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get
you selfish bitch i hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me

ladies and gentleman introducing the new and improved you know who
and follow me as i put these crayons to chaos from seance to seance
dont be scared cause there aint nothing to worry about
mush the senates face in and push this generation
of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like

im a soldier im a soldier im a soldier im a soldier
and got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin
willin to stick out my neck for respect if it meant life or death
if its true if its you what you say in your raps what you do
so they feel as part of your obligation to fulfill
when they see you on the streets face to face are you for real
in confrontation aint no conversation if you feel youre in violation
any hesitationll get you killed if you feel it kill it
if you conceal it reveal it being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
pull it squeeze it till its empty tempt me push me pussies
i need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
im a soldier these shoulders hold up so much they wont budge
these shoulders hold up so much they wont budge
like my lawyers when the fuckin judge lets me off
ill violate and all the motherfuckin bets be off
who needs bullets soon as i pull it you sweat bullets
you can hurt em and come back again and kick dirt at em
its like pourin salt in the wounds assault and get sued
you can smell the lawsuits soon as i waltz in the room
all you see is bitches comin out their halter tops
runnin and duckin out the hard rocks parking lot
youll all get shot whether its your fault or not cause
i spit it slow so these kids know that im talkin to em
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em
im like a thug with a little bit of pac influence
i spew it and look how i got you bitches rockin to it
you motherfuckers could never do it like i could do it
dont even try it youll look stupid do not pursue it
i spit the illest shit ever been dropped to two inch
so tickytock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
listen to the sound of kim as she licks on a cock
listen to the sound of me spillin my heart through this pen
motherfuckers know that ill never be marshall again
til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty and
lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity im a
hollywood sayin goodbye sayin goodbye to hollywood
why do i feel this way sayin goodbye sayin goodbye to hollywood
i thought i was tough enough to stick it out with kim
but i wasnt tough enough to juggle two things at once
which shouldve been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
how come i couldnt see this shit myself its just me
knowin damn well she wasnt gonna be there when i fell to catch me
im standin here swingin on like thirty people by myself
turned around saw gary stashin the heater in his belt
saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
i just sold two million records i dont need to go to jail
try to get my feet on solid ground so for now im
bury my face in comic books cause i dont want to look
if i could swallow a bottle of tylenol i would and end it for good
i probably should these problems are piling all at once
cause everything that bothers me i got it bottled up
so not a lot of good id be to my daughter layin in the bottom of the mud
all i know is i dont want to follow in the footsteps of my dad
the worst fear that i had was growin up to be like his fuckin ass man
i dont wanna quit but shit i feel like this is it
this is not a game this fame in real life this is sick
if i scrap ill scrap like i aint never whooped some ass
but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact ive sacrificed everything i have
i never dreamt id get to the level that im at this is whack
what about math how come i wasnt ever good at that
its like the boy in the bubble who never could adapt im trapped
i sold my soul to the devil ill never get it back
i just wanna leave this game with level head intact
cause all i wanted was to give hailie the life i never had
but instead i forced us to live alienated so im sayin
thats why i aint got no time for these games and stupid tricks or these bitches on my dick
thats how dudes be getting sick thats how dicks be getting drips falling victims to this

dont bring your gun outside of your home you cant carry it on you
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing its so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walking around with his headphones blaring
what bothers him all comes out when he talks about
cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
if he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out
his thoughts are whacked hes mad so hes talkin back
his stepfather hit him so he socked him back and broke his nose
his house is a broken home theres no control he just lets his emotions go
sing it sing for the laughter sing for the tears cmon
sing it with me just for today maybe tomorrow the good lordll take you away
entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangsters
in the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum
yet everybody just feels like they can relate i guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate
its like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
but then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn you
to get they hands on every dime you have they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
but all they kids be listenin to me religiously so im signin cds while police fingerprint me
theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me
if im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense pete
its all political if my music is literal and im a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl
i couldnt i wouldnt be fit to youre full of shit too guerrera that was a fist that hit you
well can it load a gun up for you  and cock it too
well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and ill get sued
see what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols
and they want to get one cause they think the shits cool
not knowin we really just protectin ourselves we entertainers
of course the shits affectin our sales you ignoramus
but music is reflection of self we just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail
how we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted
thats why we sing for these kids who dont have a thing
who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
or for anyone whos ever been through shit in their lives
till they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die
till they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in they eyes
thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it squeeze it and hold it
just let our spirits live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can
cause i know you want me baby i think i want you too
im here to save you girl come be in shadys world
ooh boy you drive me crazy bitch you make me hurl
they call me superman leap tall hoes in a single bound
id never let another chick bring me down in a relationship
superman aint savin shit girl you can jump on shadys dick
play no games say no names ever since i broke up with whats her face
im a different man kiss my ass kiss my lips bitch why ask
kiss my dick get my cash id rather have you whip my ass
dont put out ill put you out wont get out ill push you out
puss blew out poppin shit wouldnt piss on fire to put you out
am i too nice buy you ice bitch if you died i wouldnt buy you life
what you tryin to be my new wife what you mariah fly through twice
but i do know one thing though bitches they come they go
saturday through sunday monday monday through sunday yo
maybe ill love you one day maybe well someday grow
til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway ho
well be friends ill call you again ill chase you around every bar you attend
never know what kind of car ill be in well see how much youll be partying then
but i guess thats just what sluts do how could it ever be just us two
id never love you enough to trust you we just met and i just fucked you
first thing you say im not fazed i hang around big stars all day
hailie jade i love that name love that tattoo whats that say
first off you dont know marshall at all so dont grow partial
thats ammo for my arsenal ill slap you off that bar stool
there goes another lawsuit leave hand prints all across you
good lordy whoadie you must be gone off that water bottle
you want what you cant have ooh girl thats too damn bad
dont touch what you cant grab end up with two backhands
put anthrax on a tampax and slap you til you cant stand
girl you just blew your chance dont mean to ruin your plans
sometimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders
cause sometimes it feels like the worlds almost over
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes oh no
man if i could sing id keep singing this song to my daughter
if i could hit the notes id blow something as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her how proud i am that i got her
god im a daddy im so glad that her mom didnt
now you probably get this picture from my public persona
that im a pistolpacking drugaddict who bags on his mama
but i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
cause theres a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside o my soul
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
should i just give up or try to live up to these expectations
now look i love my daughter more than life in itself
but i got a wife thats determined to make my life livin hell
but i handle it well given the circumstances im dealt
so many chances man its too bad couldve had someone else
but the years that ive wasted are nothing to the tears that ive tasted
ive taken bats to peoples backs bent over backwards for this woman
man i shouldve seen it comin whatd i stick my penis up in
wouldve ripped the prenup up if id seen what she was fuckin
but fuck it its over theres no more reason to cry no more
i got my baby baby the only lady that i adore hailie
my babys travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
and suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
if you ever need anything daddy will be right there
 this muthafucka man its ridiculous i cant believe it hold on em what up have a seatdre ill call you back what now i dont even know where to start okay i got the album from upstairs and and this is by far the most incredible thing ive ever heard
music reality sometimes its hard to tell the difference
but we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
and i came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
what the fuck you take me for a joke you smoking crack
i get up for i get down run myself in the ground for i put some wack shit out
im tryinga smack this one out the park fivethousand mark
see me leap out pull the piece out fuck shooting im just trying to knock his teeth out
talk is cheap motherfucker if youre really feeling froggish leap
youre slim youre gonna let him get away with that
he tried to play you you cant let him scape with that
when we confuse hiphop with real life when the music stops
i have died clinically arrived back at my enemys crib with hennessey
physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
i spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently
i wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
danger had me turned into a mad man son of sam bitch im surgical
ill allergic to dying you think not you got balls we can see how large
it hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg
when you aint got nothing left but your word and your balls
and youre stressed from the calls of your new friends
if my funerals tomorrow wonder if they would even call when the music stops
im revved up who said what would lead bust your head would just explode
with red stuff im hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
braggin about how you shot it like a coward bullets devour you showered you
niggas if i was you niggas ill run while given the chance
death itself it cant hurt me just the thought of dying alone that really
irks me you aint worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
be smart and stop trying to walk how gs walk before we spark
hug the floor while we plan tugowar with your life fuck the tour and the mic
ill rather fuck a whore with a knife deliver that shit the coroners like
you high hype poppin shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night
when the uzi pop you better drop when the music stop
grew up too quick went through too much knew too much shit
till the cow just tilts and tips n stumbles to earth
creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
fuck jermaine he dont belong speaking mine or timbalands name
and dont think i dont read your little interviews and see what your saying
im a giant and i aint gotta move till im provoked
when i see you ima step on you and not even know it
ya midget minime with a bunch of little miniyous
say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
blackballed and make sure you never rap a fucking again
dre aint having it as long as im here to play devils advocate
and ima only sucker punch or swing without warning
cause i know when they get up i wont get a chance to let off
knows im about fast cars and alize partying all day
but i handle my business cause its work before play
that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
depending on your mood if it swings think too many things
feel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up
but you gotta search within you you gotta find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
till i collapse im spilling these raps long as you feel em
till the day that i drop youll never say that im not killing them
subliminal thoughts when im stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop
the criminal cop killing hiphop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners
youre coming with me feel it or not youre gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us
you hear it a lot lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am i just a product of pop fizzing up
for shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen up you bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck
music is like magic theres a certain feeling you get when youre real
this is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
so while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end
cause im at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in
i got a list heres the order of my list that its in
it goes reggie jayz tupac and biggie andre from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me
but in this industry im the cause of a lot of envy so when im not put on this list the shit does not offend me
thats why you see me walk around like nothings bothering me
even though half you people got a fucking problem with me
you hate it but you know respect youve got to give me
the presss wet dream like bobby and whitney nate hit me
what is he thinking how not to go against me smart
ill probably never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but ill never be served my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
cause in my heart of hearts i know nothing could ever be worse
thats why im clever when i put together every verse
i rap like im addicted to smack like im kim mathers
but i dont want to go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a full blown attack im launching at them
the track is on some battling raps who want some static
cause i dont really think that the fact that im slim matters
a plaque of platinum status is whack if im not the baddest so
today were gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
what do i gotta do to get through to you to show you
i cut em off i got em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
all this time me and dre been fucking with hats off
before i push this motherfucking button and blast off
blow every fucking thing except afghanistan on the map off
when will it stop when will i knock the crap off
theres really nothin else to say i i cant explain it
a little help from hailie jade wont you tell em baby
theres nothin you could do or say that could ever change me
theres no one on earth that can save me not even hailie
if you aint got nothin nice to say then dont say nothin
chew on a prick and lick a million motherfuckin cocks per second
and have pussylips glued to my face with a clitring in my nose
cant you see why im so mean if yall leave me alone this wouldnt be my
and at the same time make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
which to me isnt work so its easy to misinterpret it at first
id yank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue
id slice my gums get struck by fuckin lightning twice at once
more pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl inside of a
aimed at the world trade standin on ronnies grave
screaming at the sky till clouds gather as clyde mathers and bonnie jade
and thats pretty much the gist of itparents are pissed but the kids love
nine millimeter heater stashed in twoseaters with meat cleavers
i dont blame you i wouldnt let hailie listen to me neither
rub my back rub my back rub my back rub my back
cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do
if they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come
now here they come as we expected now we just set em up
whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas
i pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay does
opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
but i think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth
and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
cause ive been holding my tounge till i got a sprained jaw
when i come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls
we talking to everymotherfuckingbody who wants to bring it cause we bringin it to anybody who wants to bring it
theres a doberman pincher and a pitbull in the seat
flashing that flashlight on my ass where was you at
ever since me and dre split it fiftyfifty on fifty its funny
we got a buzz spreading quicker than making paperairplanes out of a twenty
i tuck two ninas under my jeans either side of my penis
when running with the long arm of the law im long gone
they aint gone gimme my semi but i got my whizz at
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
there aint nothin anyone could ever say ever do
good cause youre so fuckin beautiful when youre angry
its you and me cause any chick can say that shes screwin me
cause true indeed if you didnt i wouldnt be hittin it
but at least we know that we share this common bond
youre the only one i can fuck without a condom on
that we must always call each others billy goats gruff
we both feel like weve been upstaged by someone else
and it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle dont fit
and anybody who thinks they know us doesnt know shit
and theyre probably just tired of hearin it all the time
you told me you hate me youre gonna hate me more
when all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
i shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
the fourth letter slim you really startin to upset me
the fifth letter told me you were comin to get me
the sixth letter theres a bomb threat in our building
this crazy motherfuckers really tryin to kill me
so i went back and read the first few letters that said
the funny thing is we both know where this kid lives
so were off to toronto and were gainin speed what was that oh jermaine dupri
just tryin to find a reason for the constant hate
and tryin to figure out what happened to germaine propaine
what happened to the way you was rappin when you was scandalous
plus he raps with his regular voice what was that pet shop boys
so we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
his corpse was still movin but his ass was rotted
we stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again
stomp him switch feet stomp him switch again
i think stanabis jumped off the bridge again damn
yo check it out its fucked up and i dont see either one of us budging
and he just cant see that hes manically depressed
fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
and i know it must be fucking with you emotionally
cause you know we dont play that black and white shit
i been known to lose it when someone says something smart
hed wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
any worse were gonna lose another soldier to this game
for whatever its worth its worth me havin my arse whipped
cause ima have the last lift that ever gets arse squished
and i snap and its a wrap and its a scrap an then it isnt rap is it
hiphop isnt a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
believe me id much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol when im pissed now
but it all depends on just how far it gets took on the mic
cause im tellin you right now your not gonna like it
cause if i get pushed over the edge then im pullin you with me
when you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty
im the beatifulest thing and your gonna miss me when im gone
like kieth murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl accidently argghhh
i do this for swifty kon and kuniva bizzy  proof are you with me
if you dont know the words an you cant sing along an
in a party with heat its hard to keep me without one
constantly popin slugs they hot son better not run
the bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever aint concious
when you meet me better speak like a seasons greetins
i snipe you with it and we wont even keep it a secret
when glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
i dont need no enemies as my family a couple trucks
am i empty seein them  i emtpy out them  to fight you
no need for metaphores i get yours across when i write
so emotions enough to say fuck you bitch and i dont like you what
im awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
you probaly wish that you could be out shootin them gs
get on your knees nigga get on your knees and pray

momma had a baby and its head popped off head popped off
head popped off head popped off head popped off head popped off
my momma dont want me the next thing i know im gettin dropped off
gettin dropped off gettin dropped off gettin dropped off gettin dropped off
ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
their front porch their front porch their front porch their front porch
but they didnt want me neither so they left me on someone elses lawn
elses lawn elses lawn elses lawn til somebody finally took me in
my great aunt and uncle edna n charles edna n charles
my elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song
sang this song sang this song sang this song sang this song
momma why do they keep saying this i just dont understand understand
predominantly predominantly everythings always predominantly
predominantly white predominantly black but what about me
where does that leave me well i guess that im between predominantly
both of em i think if i hear that fuckin word again imma scream
while im projectile vomiting what do i look like a comedian to you
do you think that im kidding what do i look like some kind of idi
wait a minute shit dont answer that  why am i so misunderstood
why do i go through so much bullshit its such bullshit its tush mull bisch
woe is me there goes poor marshall again whinin about his millions
and his mansion and his sorrow hes always drownin in
from the dad he never had and how his childhood was so bad
and how his mom was a dope addict and his exwife how they go at it
man id hate to have it as bad as that mr mathers claims he had it
i cant imagine it that little rich poor white bastard
needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
i never had any of this shit planned mom please believe
i dont wanna be satans spawn never got the chance to say im sorry
dear santa claus why you not comin this year again
but life aint a fairytale im about to be hoisted up in the air
i dont even know why they feel like they know me cause im in this ferris wheel
and all i wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
without this crowd everywhere i go but life is like a merrygoround
here we go now doesedoe now curtains up the show must go
now ring around the rosie the shows over you can all go home now
but the curtain just dont close for me this aint how fame is supposed to be
wheres the switch i could just turn off and on this aint what i chose to be
so please god give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
til i pass 50 back the baton the cameras on my soul is gone
i get it from all angles even occasionally doc dreziell
to make me stop and think about it fore i just say things
sometimes i forget what other people just may think
a lot of rappers probably wouldnt know how to take me
if they heard some shit id lay the tape fore they erase me
sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
cuz i say so many rhymes it may seem like im goin too fast cuz my mind is racing
when i hit the heavenly gates ill be cool beside jayz
and im thankful for the environment that he placed me
believe it or not i thank my mom for how she raised me
in the neighborhood daily they jumped and chased me
tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake g
cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
and when you face me with all the shit youve been saving to say to me
the smell of victory love it so much i can taste it
im obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers
if im the best and the worst then gods gift is a curse
soldier trained to destroy you payin attention boy
my music is a drug press play you aint gotta sniff it
what we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough if you wish to be
saved not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or
which over we seem to be approaching an age of the gross we all have this idea that we should
move up from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better
lets get it started lets start addressing this issue and open it up
and we can discuss statements thats made on this tape
and its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
the music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy
lets rewind it to 89 when i was a boy on the east side of detroit
id like to share a story this is my story and cant no body tell it for me
you will well inform me i am well aware that i dont belong here
youve made that perfectly clear i get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
from belair shopping center just for stopping in there
through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
journey with me as i take you through this nifty little place
just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and van dyke
and drop it off at the park that was the half way mark
to meet kim had to walk back to her mamas on chalmers after dark
to sneak me in the house when im kicked out my moms
thats about the time i first met proof with goofy gary on the steps
at osbourne handing out some flyers he was doing some talent shows
at centerline high i had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
he looked at me like im out my mind shook his head like white boys dont know how to rhyme
i spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
we was on the same shit that big daddy kane shit with compound syllables sound combined
from that day we was down to ride somehow we knew wed meet again somewhere down the line
my first year in 9th grade cant forget that day at school
and said that pumas the brand cause the clan makes troops
mustve been true because man we done banned they shoes
and we just through them in the trash like they yesterdays news
professor x vanglorious exists in a state of red black and green
represents black power and we aint know what it meant
me and my man howard and butter we would go to the mall with em
all over our necks like were showing em off not knowing at all
you aint supposed to have that homie let me grab that
and that flavor flave clock we gonna have to snatch that
saying how we hate this how racist but dope the x clans tape is
which reminds me back in 89 me and kim broke up for the first time
she was tryna two time me and there was this black girl
at our school who thought i was cool cause i rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
and oh the irony guess what her name was aint even gonna say it plus
the same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
the bombest god damn girl in our whole school if i could pull it
not only would i become more popular but i would be able to piss kim off at the same time
but it backfired i was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
and thats the last i ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl
but ive heard people say they heard the tape and it aint that bad
but it was i singled out a whole race and for that apologize
i was wrong cause no matter what color a girl is shes still a hoe
im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i aint never supposed to show it my crew aint supposed to know it
even if it means goin toe to toe with a benzino it dont matter
id never drag them in battles that i can handle unless i absolutely have to
i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
if some shit ever does pop off im supposed to be beside em
that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailies name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy this shit went way beyond some jayz and nas shit
and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it
i spent too much energy on it honestly im exhausted
and im so caught in it i almost feel im the one who caused it
this aint what im in hiphop for its not why i got in it
i went through my whole career without ever mentionin
and that was just out of respect for not runnin my mouth
and talkin about something that i knew nothing about
plus dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
while hes all over tv down talkin a man who literally saved my life
but still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute cause
there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
and wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin
but now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it
the shit gets escalated it aint just words no more is it
its a different ball game callin names and you aint just rappin
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin
me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
until ja started yappin in magazines how we stabbed him
meanwhile my attention is pullin in other directions
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that ill be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now hes fucked the game up cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication the same one that made me famous
now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin
well fuck it that motherfucker can get it too fuck him then
but im so busy being pissed off i dont stop to think
and hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind
thats willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to extort us strictly to show they support us
well maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus
to show them we love em back and let em know how important it is
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
but i aint tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
it aint worth it i cant think of a perfecter way to word it
then to just say that i love yall too much to see the verdict
ill walk away from it all before i let it go any further
but dont get it twisted its not a plea that im coppin
if yall can quit poppin off at the jaws well then i can
im not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cause
i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america
i give sight to the blind my insight through the mind
i exercise my right to express when i feel its time
its just all in your mind what you interpret it as
i say to fight you take it as imma whip someones ass
slash entrepreneur who has helped launch a few more rap acts
whos had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
come along follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
we gonna fight we gonna charge we gonna stomp we gonna march
come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little
just let it gradually build from the front to the back
all you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
dont matter what color all that matters we gathered together
to celebrate for the same cause dont matter the weather
they aint gonna stop us they cant we stronger now more than ever
they tell us no we say yea they tell us stop we say go
rebel with a rebel yell raise hell we gonna let em know
stomp push shove mush fuck bush until they bring our troops home cmon
how could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
strap him with an ak47 let him go fight his own war
no more blood for oil we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
no more psychological warfare to trick us to thinking that we aint loyal
if we dont serve our own country were patronizing a hero
the stars and stripes theyve been swiped washed out and wiped

i knew i shouldnt go and get another tattoo of you
i cant believe i went and did this stupid shit again

any opinions or somethin you just wanna get off your chest
all you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
and if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key

i even believe i had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
my aim was not to become what i became with this level of fame
unless of course you were given the consent to join in
which isnt as bad as long as you show some remorse for your actions
either before during or after performing the act of that which
is normally referred to have such more commonly known phrases
whos to say whats fair to say and what not to say

im going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
now i need you to open your mindyour eyes close them
whenever theres conversation why am i always mentioned
but i can bust one take without lookin at no paper
id be so embarrassed im just absolutely terrified
just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
cuz thats exactly what your eyes look like want to check to see
youre both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on em
this is between me and you i know youre not happy
i know youd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
there is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
why you even doing this to yourself its pointless
why do we have to keep on going through this this is tortuous
and i know that hes not thrilled about the video
you should really take a look at the man in the mirror
and tell him to beat it because i wont stop till i get enough
do you remember the time we were watching the billy jean video
because i cant stop loving him and i hate plastic surgeons
down down down down down down down down down down
and i dont mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation
but im feelin just a little stressed out from work
could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
whats your sign man you must be up out your mind
i dont have any lines to go right here so chubba teletubbie
grab you left nut make your right one jealous what
i dont believe it its almost too good to be true
i am not resisting arrest i am agreeing mr officer
i cant get on the ground any further its impossible for me
and do not treat me like a murderer i just like to pee pee pee
for i am triumph the puppet dog i am a mere puppet
i can get away with anything i sing you will love it
now theyre getting older theyre starting to grow bum bums
please do not remove me from this movie theater please
i didnt mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
and dont treat me like im pee wee herman this movies pg
i will simply plead innocent cop a plea and be free
what you mean my lawyers with michael hes too busy
i am triumph britney spears has shoulders like a man
and i can say that and youll laugh cuz that is a puppet on my hand
maybe next year ill say ass and shell make my pee pee go
my computers would be seized and my keys to my ranch
i just baked cookies mr officer looky take a whiff of these
i dont even know if i can say the word pee pee pee
i dont think my joke is working i must flee quick
if theres any bitches in this room then theres something i gotta say
for all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
ive been down that road and now im back sittin on square one
i never woulda thought that id see you outta control
you should know between us we was like mates to soul
and obies grinning then you invite that obies cold
so whats required is that you chill with all that fire
lord knows i was right cuz you just crossed the line
still aint got a fuckin clue as to who you truly are
almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
till you went as far as goin and snoopin through my drawers
now i just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
cant believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
if you recall i used to treat you as a groupie broad
when we fucked i refused to even take my jewelry off
but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off
it was a shock it struck me as odd but it turned me on
you started getting moody on me pretty soon wed argue
and the ruder you got the more beautiful you got to me
and who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly
cupid could shoot another one of them god damn darts at me
but when someone seems too good to be true they usually are
till you pull up and see some other dudes car parked and reach
and just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
you hear them words echoing almost haunting that taunting ring
but you was different thought we shared a covenant
even held your hand in public we sufferin because of this
ill admit i was caught in the mix down to commit
but who coulda predicted to know your triflin ways woulda stopped our growth
em introduced us 50 this is tanya tanya this is 50
with my imagination i could see her suckin my dick
we played the phone game a week later shit changed fast
downtown manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
penthouse full of imported shit you know how i grind
she got to talkin talkin like an opportunist too
why talk when suckin my dick is the real career move
said shes an inspiring actress she do videos for practice
yeah yeah know how many times i done heard that shit
i know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
hailie i know you miss your mom and i know you miss your dad
when im gone but im trying to give you the life that i never had
i can see youre sad even when you smile even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes deep inside you want to cry
daddys always on the move mammas always on the news
i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that the more it backfires on me
all the things growing up as daddy that he had to see
daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
but then of course everything always happens for a reason
but its just something we have no control over and thats what destiny is
but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day well wake up and this will all just be a dream
i know mommys not here right now and we dont know why
and stuck em under the tree and said some of em were from me
ill never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night crying
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mammas heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and thats when daddy went to california with his cd and met dr dre
but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
then you started seeing daddy on the tv and momma didnt like it
and you and lainnie were too young to understand it
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now im sitting in this empty house just reminiscing
lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now
wow i guess you pretty much are and daddys still here
and if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine
and make him eat every carat dont fuck with dad ha ha
i go skitzo i get so insane i just go skitzophrenic
they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
which would explain why youre such a motherfucking bitch
but i stay and still stick it out with you even though i just hit you today
but you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
just cuz i came home late last night crawled in bed and i woke you
but if theres one thing about you i admire its baby
because you stay with me maybe because youre as crazy as i am
cuz when i look at you i can see an angel in your eyes
but if i look deeper inside i see your freakish little side
nigga fuck my wife im tryna run and save my motherfucking life
im tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
saying she didnt mean to diss me earlier and she crying
but its real and its on and cats is getting killed
so i hugged her and used her body as a human shield
i told her id be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
i squeezed through the back door and made my escape
nigga ive been tryna call you all day motherfucker where you at
im gonna meet you at the club were gonna fuck these hoes up
ive never seen no shit like this in my life before
people are wall to wall three thousand and some odd fans
decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of em off
missed who hes aiming for six feet aways the door
into the same entrance hall now the strays flying all over the place
grazed one bitch in the face another one of em came through the wall
before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
bullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
and where the fuck is von he usually tucks one on him
i go to grab her up by the damn hand but i cant pull her
god damn there just went another damn bullet im hit
made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
but denauns right behind him squeezing his four fifth
i aint come in this bitch to party i came in this bitch to fight
although i cant stay here to fight cause im popping niggas tonight
shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when i get in
swift told me to meet him here so its clear that this fucker
shoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker
thirds for the bartender theres plenty of shots to go
i just wanna know whos driving a black mitsubishi
he tried to run so proof shot him in the knee with a three piece
so all my people on the left all my people on the right
bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
you a fad that means your something that we already had
but once youre gone you dont come back too bad
enough with all the pissin and moanin whinin and bitchin
sit and observe listen youll learn if you pay attention
worldwide were on the charts with a bullet and still climbin
when dr dre say crunk you will get it crunk get it crunk
and when 50 cent says jump you get on one foot and jump
the buzz is tremendous we drop you all to sense it
i dont gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
we aint showin off we just goin off popular consensus
doc is this doc is that you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cock of doc cuz doc left you all guessin
so dj take the needle and just drop it on the record what
we gon have this mutherfucker hoppin in a second bump bump
to make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
cuz we done swam with the sharks wrestle with alligators
when dres involved theres plenty money involved
and plenty honeys involved the sunny sundays and palm trees
cali everyday its just another party from the valleys
you could catch me in the studio bangin out the beats to
provide you with the heat that keep blazin out your speaker
along with gunit records presents the return of thethe doc and shady
we tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
50 cent gunit obie trice dtwizzy stat quo dr dre

and have another episode where i let it go as far as
the one with benzino did im waiting for that next beef
my dicks so hard anna nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
its a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
everybody just wants to have something to do with that
they probably just now finally understand how to rob fully
and a damn slot machine at the same time as each other
two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
what a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in jamaica queens
two years later me and doc had to come and uh operate
or see eye to eye therell always be animosity between you and i
but see the difference is if it is i could give a shit
still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
swallow your pride fore i step on it with shoes you call nikes
earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
stomping i been romping since tim dogg was hollering
i was whilin free styling back when they was still making maxell cassettes
that tells us that any doubts in your head that seals the shit
theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
he wont have it he knows his whole backs to these ropes
when he goes back to his mobile home thats when its
he better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him
you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
the souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
a normal life is boring but superstardoms close to postmortem
coast to coast shows hes known as the globetrotter
tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
i was playing in the beginning the mood all changed
ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
but i kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
and i cant provide the right type of life for my family
cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers
and its no movie theres no mekhi phifer this is my life
and these times are so hard and its getting even harder
teeter totter caught up between being a father and a primadonna
stay in one spot another day of monotonys gotten me
ive got to formulate a plot or i end up in jail or shot
success is my only motherfucking option failures not
hit the strip club dont forget ones get your dick rubbed

since im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
i aint no politician but ill kick it within a minute
cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits ill wear it
but if it dont then yall swallow the truth grin and bear it
now whos the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
using his music to steer it sharing his views and his merits
but theres a huge interference theyre saying you shouldnt hear it
maybe its hatred i spew maybe its food for the spirit
maybe its beautiful music i made for you to just cherish
but im debated disputed hated and viewed in america
as a motherfucking drug addict like you didnt experiment
now now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrassed
and i got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents

jesus christ the king of these latter day saints here
to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate satan and scatterbrained atheist
but that aint the case see its a matter of taste
we as a people decide if shadys as bad as they say he is
see its as easy as cake simple as whistling dixie
while im waving the pistol at sixty christians against me

and i dont usually trip or dare get caught up in that
but when they say one of the best im nowhere thought of as that
and that very well may be the same reason they dont say me
when they speak on hiphop legends which has amazed me
so maybe the 80s made me crazy i been tryin to get my weight
up since the a slim shady gave me the gate key paid the ways
so lately mind states get better each day replay my relay race

we should all get a merit this much beef we inherit
and wear it like a badge with honor pass it around and share it
and let it go to whoevers holding the most current beef on their shoulders
but tonight we aint coming here to beef with nobody

let us never forget it or should we ever live to regret it
like the day john f kennedy was assasinated in broad day
who just happened to work on the same block in a library book depository
where the president would go for a little friday stroll
hard headed and hot headed bull headed and pig headed
quick witted for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics
this dynamite stick buried the wick its gonna explode any minute
do not tell me to stop yelling when i stop selling i quit
you fuckers are not ready cause i got jelly like beyonces pot belly
no remorse for me like there was no recourse for me
i can spit in ya face while your standin across from me no apologies
my head hits the pillow a weeping willow i cant sleep a pain so deep it bellows
but these cellos help just to keep me mellow hands on my head touched knees to elbow
im hunched over emotion just flows over these cold shoulders are both frozen you dont know me
i keep saying it i cant stress it enough so keep playing it and stand next to the subs
i choke mics like asphyxiation when im stranglin my own throat masturbatin
fuck yeah im a basket case and i mastered this rap shit til my ass gets wasted til my assassination
44 mags a fascination a taste for disaster and if thats the case then
hes able to spill raps long after his killed thats a real mc
you still agree as long as theres still this hunger and will in me
id be a savage beast if i aint have this outlet to salvage me inside

i dont know i dont know what caused i dont know what caused me to be this way
i dont know i dont know but i probably be this way til my dying day
i dont know why im so im so cold mean things i dont mean to say
i just want to thank everybody for being so patient
and bearing with me over these last couple of years
if there is let me hear just so i know im not the only one
but there was no one who even knew that i was going through growin pains
its like i was jealous of him cause of the attention he was gettin
and i knew it but proof wasnt here to see me through it
im in the booth poppin another pill tryna talk myself into it
are you stupid you gon start dissin people for no reason
especially when you cant even write a decent punchline even
youre lying to yourself youre slowly dying youre denying
your health is declining with your selfesteem youre crying out for help
marshall youre no longer the man thats a bitter pill to swallow
all i know is im wallowin selfloathing and hollow
i dont see nobody else i guess i keep talkin to myself
but all these other rappers suck is all that i know
ive turned into a hater ive put up a false bravado
but marshall is not a egomaniac thats not his motto
hes not a desperado hes desperate its starting to bottle inside em
fallin asleep with writers block in the parking lot of mcdonalds
but instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it
admit you got a problem you brain is clouded you pouted long enough
so i pick myself off the ground and fuckin swam fore i drowned

man im so fuckin sick i got ambulances pullin me over and shit
ya need to stop drop and roll cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip hop shop the blow
i just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses if you mistook the for a song look
this aint a song its a warnin to brooke hogan and david cook
im lightning in a skillet your a fuckin flash in a pan
i pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin a fan
yeah im pissed but i would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
salivas like sufiric acid in your hand itll eat through anything metal the ass of iron man
turn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin chance is assanine
hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
pull up in a van and hop out at a homeless man holdin a sign sayin
kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand
so if i seem a little mean to you this aint savage you aint never seen a brute
you couldnt make a belemic puke on a piece of fuckin corn and peanut poop
sayin you sick quit playin you prick dont nobody care
i aint even talkin to noone cause aint nobody there
nobody will fuckin test me cause these hos wont even dare
im wastin punchlines but i got so many to spare i just thought of another one that might go here
plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about michaels hair
man im so hot my motherfuckin firetrucks on fire homie
ya need to stop drop and roll cause when you say the shit to give the whole hip hop shop the blow
i cut my toes off and step on the receipt before i foot the bill

these other cats aint metaphorically where im at man

make like michael j fox in the drawers playin with a etchasketch
bet you that youll never guess whos knocking at your door
need i remind you that i dont need the fucking swine flu to be a sick pig
white trash with a half a six pack in his hatchback
bitch am i the reason that your boyfriend stopped rapping
does a bird chirp lil wayne slurps syrup til he burps
does a word search gets circles wrapped around it like you do when i come through
or youre the kind of girl that i can take a liking to
whats the saying where theres thunder theres lightning
and they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
so hit the dance floor cutie while i do my duty on this microphone
pull up to the club in a pinto likes its a porsche
but he aint stupid so quit tryin to run them games on him
hes immune to cupid why you tryin to put your claims on him
cause you wont do to me what you did to the last man
theres a half a gallon in it that could be our last chance
we have of just gettin home now could i get that lap dance
in the streets of warren michigan we call em tramp stamps
that means she belongs to me time to put the damn clamps
lookin like a zombie from night of the livin dead
and tomorrow i probably still be too high to get outta bed
til i feel like i been hit wit the sharp parta the hammer
missed the tree and hit rudolph and two innocent bystanders
get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin
cause as soon as they throw on some rkelly i start ballin
but im not throwin ones fives tens or even twenties
im throwin quarters nickels dimes pennies up at skinnies
muffle it cause homie that hoods tighter than kennys

he wouldnt fuckin shoot at nobody hed fight first
its in their best interest to protect their investment
and i just lost my fuckin best friend so fuck it i guess then
dont know what im gonna do but i just keep on going through changes
thats understandable man but think how bananas youd be
youd be an animal too if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
and everybodys lookin at you what you want me to do
im startin to live like a recluse and the truth is
fames startin to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
i sit alone in my home theater watchin the same damn dvd
of the first tour the last tour he was still alive
and it hurts so i fast forward sleepin pills will make me feel alright
ill just take a couple more yeah youre motherfuckin right
i aint slowin down for no one i am almost homeward bound
daddy dont you die on me daddy better hold your ground
dont know what im gonna do but i just keep on going through changes
wake up in the hospital full of tubes but somehow im pullin through
ima do it just for proof i think i should state a few
facts cause i may not get a chance again to say the truth
shit it just hit me that what if i would not have made it through
i think about the things i would have never got to say to you
id never get to make it right so heres what i came to do
hailie this one is for you whitney and alaina too
think about her every day we just could never get it together
hey wish there was a better way for me to say it
but i swear on everything id do anything for her on any day
there are just too many things to explain when it rains
guess it pours yes it does wish there wasnt any pain
but i cant pretend there aint i aint placin any blame
i aint pointin fingers heaven knows ive never been a saint
i know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
and just today i looked at your picture almost if to say
i miss you subconsciously wish it didnt end this way
holler if you feel like youve been down the same road same road
i guess i had to go to that place to get to this one
you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay em
but you wont take the sting out these words before i say em
cause aint no way ima let you stop me from causing mayhem
feed it beans its gassed up if it thinks its stopping me
ima be what i set out to be without a doubt undoubtedly
and all those who look down on me im tearing down your balcony
no ifs ands or buts dont try to ask him why or how can he
hes still shitting whether hes on salary paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
hes married to the game like a fuck you for christmas
his gift is a curse forget the earth hes got the urge
to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
okay quit playing with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
i shouldnt have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know its a rap
you said you was king you lied through your teeth for that
fuck your fillings instead of getting crowned youre getting capped
and to the fans ill never let you down again im back
i promise to never go back on that promise in fact
all im trying to say is get back clickclack blow
its a game called circle and i dont know how im way too up to back down
but i think im still trying to figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out but i guess i didnt this fucking black cloud
still follows me around but its time to exorcise these demons
for you so i could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
and dont even realize what you did cause believe me you
i been through the ringer but they could do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye i feel like the king of
my world haters can make like bees with no stingers
to focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
and raise it you couldnt lift a single shingle on it
cause the way i feel im strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
id shoot for the moon but im too busy gazing at stars
just feels like were a lot different kinda feels like were on a whole different page right now
it feels strange but uh i guess its kinda like its kinda like
i feel like im morphing into something thats so incredible that im dwarfing all competitors
better get your girlfriend in check its psychological warfare endorphin side affect
his self esteem shatters his dialect comes blasting out your deck she loves me
such passion youd expect this sort of reaction from her yet you strong arm
youre fucking corny you try to turn your charm on cause you just think your bishop the don juan
but if you think that youre fucking with me homie youre on one
im cocking my head back like ed lover cmon son shes on my johnson
she brings my name up constant your boys are like shes fucking with dude she wants him
oh boy you better get a clue shes on my dick cause i spit better than you what you expect her to do
how you expect her to act in the sack when shes closing her eyes fantasizing of digging her nails in my back to this track
seduction seduce aint nobody whos as good at what i do
cause one minute she loves you the next she dont
she says its quicker to count the things that aint wrong with you than to count the things that are
theres a seven disc cd changer in her car and im in every single slot and youre not aww
the star and im not about to sit back and just keep rhyming one syllable aww
switch it up and watch them haters not give it up cause ya just not good enough
well im not giving up til i get my respect and i wont stop til i get enough
cause im not living up to my own expectations aww
that hater alarm is sounding off that obama took the bomb from my name aww
so quit crying that i took your dame homie shes my dame aww
you sadly mistaking if you thinking that im not on my game boy
and things just aint been the same since the day that i came forth
you wear your heart on your sleeve i sport that white tank boy
but you got a hard on for me what you hollering my name for

its like an explosion every time i hold you i wasnt joking when i told you
im a space bound rocket ship and your hearts the moon
two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in june

and flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
rewound the future to the present paused it dont ask how

but didnt come to bore you with the cinderella story
who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
its in ya ass hes in ya ass hes all up in ya psyche too
i dont think she understands the sacrifices that i made
maybe if this bitch had acted right i wouldve stayed
but ive already wasted over half of my life i wouldve laid
took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
command it and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit
and what i mean is that i will no longer let you control me
i gave up my life for you totally devoted to you while ive stayed
faithful all the way this is how i fucking get repaid
look at how i dress fucking baggy sweats go to work a mess
always in a rush to get back to you i aint heard you yet
not even once say you appreciate me i deserve respect
ive done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
and i know that if i end this ill no longer have nothing left
but you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
and i wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath
hows it feel now yeah funny aint it you neglected me
but a special place for you in my heart i have kept
i feel like when i bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you
now im special i didnt feel special when i was with you
my friends keep asking me why i cant just walk away from

make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped you
but if im what you wanted whyd you panic when i grabbed you
girl dont be so frantic im just a hopeless romantic
dont try to fight the feeling of something thats organic
just drop them panties to the floor lets get to camcordin
soon as you wrote your number on a napkin i was bound to work a number on your back and
my love has got you so blinded you couldnt pick amy winehouse out of a lineup
lets get the pineapple schnapps going no onell knock cause ima hang a sign up

now here i come screaming a tac like i just stepped on one

you gon fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
not even austin powers how the fuck are they mike meyers
to the whacko fore i take a shit in his jackolantern
dont call me the champ call me the space shuttle destroyer
i just blew up the challenger matta fact i need a lawyer
to make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like vern troyer
laughed at infinite now hes back like someone pissed in his wheaties
his new slim shady eps got the attention of the mighty d r e
now there he goes in dres studio cuppin his balls
spewing his hate to these haters showing no love for these broads
he aint given em shit he says hell pinch a penny so hard
hell leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
when it scars till abraham lincoln is screaming out awww
his metaphors and similes aint similar to them not at all
if they dont like it they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
they can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
like david carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
then they better pull me take me back to 9th grade to school me
cause i aint looking back only forward this whole spot blow it
who could have known hed grow to be a poet and not know it
and while im being poetic let me get historic and raise the bar
higher than my opinion of these womens been lowered
i cant breathe but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right its like im in flight
its like im huffing paint and i love her the more i suffer i suffocate
and right before im about to drown she resuscitates me
its so insane cause when its going good its going great
im superman with the wind at his back shes lois lane
but when its bad its awful i feel so ashamed i snapped
you ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when youre with em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit em
you swore youd never hit em never do nothing to hurt em
now youre in each others face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
you push pull each others hair scratch claw bit em
guess that they dont know you cause today that was yesterday
sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
now i know we said things did things that we didnt mean
and we fall back into the same patterns same routine
maybe thats what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
next time im pissed ill aim my fist at the drywall
i miss the days of old thinking about you about you
somewhere in me deep down theres something in me he found
that made him believe in me now no one can beat me now
you try itll be them doors on dres fans believe me clowns
but i want it all im not just talking awards homie

i dont think you understand how much you meant to me
so sick itll blow up the mic itll put the dyna in mite
yeah itll make the dopest mc wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
tap dancing all over the beat itll jump off the page and spit itself
guess that the best thing i could do right now doody for you is to rap
so im gonna fuck til i die yeah im a do it to death
and instead of mourning your death id rather celebrate your life
elevate to new heights step on the gas and accelerate im a need 2 mics
cause the way that im feeling tonight everything i can just do right
theres nothing that i can do wrong im too strong and im just too hyped
just finish the rhyme and bust it excuse this corny metaphor
but theyll never ketchup to all this energy that ive mustard
so god just help me out while i fight through this grieving process
ive been patiently watching this game pacing these hallways
proof you knew id come out of this slump rise from these ashes

so hes vague so they mistake him for just bein crazed
you dont think hes strange you turn around and tell him peace and thanks

tell that psycho to stick a tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt

i dont paint the portrait of the picture perfect partridge family
this aint your orphan annie no this is more uncanny
kick down dakota fannings front door while the whore is tanning

hand me jack daniels spray paintin the die hard fan
livin it up with a couple of sluts feelin nautious
were drinkin its been a couple of days since ive slept
my dick is sore from fuckin when i bust theres nothin left
just dust back on the stage give me my microphone
strappin with the audience as we perform hypersong
brought it on stage and bashed it to pieces with an aluminum bats stanks
yeah i said my dick is sore but i aint say shit about my balls
whatever i didnt drink on my bladder pack it up and take the rest with me
whats new what kinda fuckin glue youd think id be if i was glue
but were back now yeah we took our time while our blood grew
only thing were in a hurry for now is to rush you
and were back these days if you dont got the guts or the nuts to
pussy go pick your pussy leaves off your cunt tree fuck you
still got a just a few of us left but itd be unjust to rob us our just due
but we cant stop now we done had too much of our blood drew from this
i heard a noise where you goin what are you bananas
of whipped cream what the hell you gonna do with that
shes proly gonna kill ya still wanna check see

pretend shes your little sista  little sista
and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is
and im in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes
and i know i got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that i gotta get out
theyre probably gonna think that im coming off as cocky haha
like i just started giving a fuck what you really think about me
like theres some kind of a aura of that of the king around me
surround me with nothin but gangsters killers and bangers
and i feel like im more comfortable around them than i do my own motherfuckin neighbors
but see my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when i leave
but why does it seem like im not even put up in the same category as other emcees
and its easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
knowing god damn well that im one of the best motherfucking rappers who ever lived period
because how would it look if they considered me as a goat
or maybe i could be takin it wrong and theyre tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
see you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that paul walls white
cause lyrically he doesnt pose a threat to anyone see hes just aight
so now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show right
theres somethin about a white boy talking black and runnin around with a damn grill in his mouth
isnt it ironic that the best rappers white and the best golfers black
and im the one whos gotta catch all the flack offa that
but these are the people who never had heard of an eminem until 8 mile had came out
thought i committed career suicide so i had to turn back into the bad guy
and yall can sit and argue about whos the motherfuckin best
before you get your panties in a motherfuckin bunch
but before i go id like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasnt there from the start
cause i know that you know that i know that you know that i know that you know
at us now youll see the apple didnt fall too far from the tree
from other players in this game on the surface it may
everybody whose basically supported me from day one
cashis your gonna be a beast when you get out there man
it aint nothin in my way so i may aswell fly away
it aint nothin else to say so i may aswell fly away
i know you wanna see me down but we aint gon die today
cos ive been to the top and theres nowhere else to go
the only way to see me is if you lookin up from down below
and theres nothin else to say so i may aswell fly away
and theres nothin in my way so i may aswell fly away
and you aint gotta tell me notin boy get off of my nuts
wipe my ass with a tissue and roll it back up in a roll
im back in ya hair sorry for leavin you stranded
they cant sit i dont think anybody understands it
especially when the worlds silly putty in ya hands its playdough
i aint got to play though they say i died in a fatal
homie you got it backwards your dippin your soup inside ya crackers
i was chasin the dragon i dont know what happened
it was like the feelin i had when i first started rappin
i just couldnt seem to get back and recapture that magic
so i went back to the lab thats where ive been at when
it aint nothin else to say so i may aswell fly away
i took a hiatus haters now im back to cause trouble
got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
the hospital wont even give you cough drops for course cocksucker
i told em ill grow up one day and show em id be able to choke clouds
georgie porgie kissed the girls make the girls cry for em
make em swarm make em fight over the shirts ive worn
yes im livin the dream homie cant nothin compare
its like these people are steps now all they do is stare
these haters is so pussy theyre afraid to be scared
they spat in my face now im back to do them the same exact way
and slap it back out before i step back out of this crap thanks
slap me now im slapping em back hey fuck it well slap back
and i aint looking back infact they can stare at my ass crack
tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work
all it takes is one song on the radio youre right back on it
reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
and left me so burnt spent a lot of time trying to soul search
well ive never recovered but tonight i betcha that whatcha
bout to go throughs tougher than anything i ever have suffered
cant think of a better way to define poetic justice
can i hold grudges mind saying let it go fuck this
hearts saying i will once i bury this bitch alive
and to think i used to think you was the shit bitch
think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch
finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew sic knit wit
thought some time had past and id forget it forget it
you expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed
and dont think cause hes been out the picture so long
that ive stopped the plottin and still aint coming to get ya
and the way you played him same shit you did to me cold
feelings i harbor all this pentup resentment i hold on to
my life is garbage and im bout to take it out on you
finally i found your new address park in your drive
feel like i been waiting on this moment all of my life
and its now arrived and my mouth is fulla saliva
my knife is out and im ducking on the side of your house
such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya
but i aint here for ya empathy i dont need your apology
or your friendship or sympathy its revenge that i seek
so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this
stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk
and heres your bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck
well hows this for publicity stunt this should be fun
last album now cause after this youll be officially done
i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
that sirens i hear guess 90 on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea
hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car
well gotta go almost at the bridge haha big bro its for you
slim this is for him and frank ocean hope you can swim good
i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
im the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
nope its hopeless im the denial that youre hopelessly in
but you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again
backs to the wall im stacking up all them odds toilets clogged
yeah cause im talking a lotta shit but im backing it all up
but in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers
im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged
grab for some water but im that pill thats too jagged to swallow
but the doublestandards you have when it comes to your daughters
cause marshall mathers the rappers personas half a façade and
matthew and stan just symbolic of you not knowing what you had til its gone
cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow
biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits
trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
then crashed in the side of locomotive with rap im loco
a jedi in training colossal brain and thoughts of entertaining
but docile and impossible to explain and im also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting
puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk
cant even find the page i was writing this rhyme on oh
its on a rampage couldnt see what i wrote i write small
it says ever since i drove a 79 lincoln with white walls
had a fire in my heart and a dire desire to aspire to die hard
so as long as im on the clock punching this time card
but sometimes when im sleeping she comes to me in my dreams
is she taken is she mine dont got i dont care dont have two shits to give
let me take you by the hand to promise land and threaten everyone
has he taken any time to show you what you need to live
if he had he wouldnt have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
i wouldnt be so mad my attitude wouldnt be so bad yeah dad
im the epitome and the prime example of what happens
when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and
even if it is charles manson who just happens to be rapping
blue lights flashing laughing all the way to the bank
lamping in my kmart mansion im in the style department
with great power comes absolutely no responsibility for content
rebel without a cause who caused the evolution of rap
hip hop is the devils music is that me it belongs to me
cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
that dont honk but every time i speak you hear a beep
but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper
and torture everyone that is my plan my job here isnt done
whos your daddy i dont give a fuck but i wonder
has he taken any time to show you what you need to live
when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
so spread the word cause im promoting my passion til im passed out
so bitch shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
bitch where the fuck were you tuesday with who you say
i wasnt at the studio bitch whatcha do screw dre
you went there looking for me boo that excuse is to lame
keep playin me you gon end up with a huge goose egg
you fake lyin slut you never told me you knew drake
you tryin to flip this on me if i spent more time with you you say
well screw you and ill be the third person who screwed you today
well youre too twofaced for me thought you was my number one true blue ace
and i cant see you when you make that wittle booboo face
cause im hangin up this phone boo you make my fuckin blue tooth ache
go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurf and puke blue kool aid
my life would be so much better if youd just drop dead
i was layin in bed last night thinkin and this thought just popped in my head
and i thought wouldnt shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead i would feel so much better
think i just relapsed this bitch pushed me over the brink
hop on the freeway tryin to get some time alone and just think
till the cops pulled me over but they let me go cause i told em im only drivin drunk cause that bitch drove me to drink
im back on my fuck hoes with a whole new hatred for blondes
but bias i hate all bitches the same baby come on
excuse the pun but bitch is such a broad statement and im
channelin my anger through every single station thats on
cause she ripped it in two paarts and threw it in the garbage
guess its time for me to get the dust off and pick myself up off the carpet
aaahhh i hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
cause you told me youd love me forever bitch that was a lie
now i never wanted someone to die so bad in my fuckin life
and im a have a whale of a time being a single sailor
catches hoe i got an oscar attached to my fuckin name dayla
made for me say fuck it kick some shots back git hammered and nail her
these bitches tryin get attached but there failin to latch onto the tail of
my bumper theyre scratchin at the back of my trailer
like im itchin to get hitched yeah im rich as a bitch
but bitches aint shit id rather leave a bitch in a ditch
but you still throw yourself at me thats what i call pitchin a bitch
long as i got a bat and two balls its foul but my dicks on strike
so all that love shit is null and void bitch im a droid
i avoid cupid stupid wasnt for blow jobs youd be unemployed
gettin sick of these girlsgirlsgirls oink oink oink
you fuckin pigs all youre good for is doink doink doink
ill take em all out i hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
drop dead and im a throw a fuckin party after this
wasnt ready to be no millionaire i was illprepared
i was prepared to be ill though the skill was there
it was bout busting raps and standing for something fucking acronym
cut the fucking act like youre happy im fucking back again
with another anthem why stop when it doesnt have to end
it aint over til i say its over � enough when i say enough
when the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit i salivate at it
hold them bitches straighter up wave em til you dislocate a rotator cuff
i aint deflate enough last chance to make this whole stadium erupt cause
i can see the finish line with each line that i finish
im so close to my goals i can almost pole vault over the goal post
and if i dont got enough in the tank maybe i can just siphon enough
to fill up this last can man will i survive in this climate or what
top 5 in this motherfucker and if i dont make the cut
what like i give a fuck i will light this bitch up like im driving a truck
and if there should ever come a time where my lifes in a rut
and i look like i might just give up eh mightve mistook
me for bowing out i aint taking a bow im stabbing myself
with a fucking knife in the gut while im wiping my butt
cause i just shitted on the mic and i like getting cut
i get excited at the sight of my blood youre in a fight with a nut
let me remind you of what got me this far picture me quitting
now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
but dont come unless you come to battle im mad now jump in the saddle
this is it its what you eat sleep piss and shit
live breathe your whole existence just consists of this
refuse to quit fuse is lit cant diffuse the wick
its all i know how to do as soon as i get thrown in the booth i spit
but my respect is overdue im showing you the flow no one do
so theres nothing for me to fall back on i know no other trade
so you better trade your fucking mics in for some toolboxes
itll have to be pried from me so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
but i want you to doubt me i dont want you to believe
self esteem must be fucking shooting throughtheroof cause trust me
i must be allergic to failure cause every time i come close to it
i used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
thats why im scoffing at authority defiant often
so i am noncompliant at home at school im just shy and awkward
tryna diagnose why i have all these underlying problems
either that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet
trying not to be noticed cause im crying and sobbing
ill be your savior from all the wars that are fought
cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mind boggling
cause i obsess on everything in my mind small shit
bothers me but not my father he said sayonara then split
theres batteries in my walkman nothings the matter with me
shit look on the bright side at least i aint walking
i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a ten speed which ive acquired parts that i
headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
why bother even try and put up a fight its nonsense
but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
why dont i just blast a little something like onyx
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
say what i wanna say to the kid that said that i eyeballed him
grab hold of my balls like thats right fights on bitch
who wouldve knew from the moment i turned the mic on that
now i think the fact that im differently wireds awesome
cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit
you fucking worship the ground in which i am walking
cause you dicks butt kiss a bunch of brian baldingers
you dont respect the legacy i leave behind yall can
suck a dick the day you beat me pigsll fly out my ass
theres no guarantee its not up to me we can only see
came to the world at a time when in was in need of a villain
but dont think i ever stopped to think that i was speakin to children
everything was happenin so fast it was like i blinked sold 3 million
then it all went blank all i remember is feelin ridiculous cause i was getting sick of this feelin
like im always under attack man i coulda stacked my shit list to the ceilin
thinkin if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him
guess im a little bit of a hypocrite when im rippin shit but since when did this many
people ever give a shit what i had to say its just my opinion
if it contradicts how im livin put a dick in your rearend
i thanked you for it for drawin more attention toward it
cause it gave me an enormous platform im flattered you thought i was that important
but you cant ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it
good luck tryin to convince a blopde its like telling gwen stefani that she sold out
in anyones mind one day id go down in history think they know now
everywhere that you go people want to go home everyone knows
theres no place you can hide you are just an asshole
everyone knows everyone knows thanks for the support asshole
quit actin salty i was countin on you to count me out
ask asher roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out
thought i was history well god damn honky that compliments like backhandin a donkey good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
nah im off him but what the fucks all this trash talking about
the fight was fixed im back and you cant stop me you knocked me down
i went down for the count i fell but the fans caught me and now
youre gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me to take my belt
word to pacquiao momma said there aint nothin else to talk about
better go in that ring and knock em out or you better not come out
its poetry in motion like freddie roach when hes quotin
you think its a joke till your bullet riddled but you should give little shit what i think
vest on your chest and a glock just to go watch batman
half you dont got the guts intestinal blockage rest of you got lap bands
stuck to this motto fore they put bath salts in all those
water bottles in colorado so get lost waldo my souls escaping through this asshole that is gaping
a black hole and im swallowin this track whole better pack toilet paper
but im takin no crap hoe here i go down the bat pole and im changing back into that ole maniac in fact there they go tryin to dip out the back door retreating
holy mackerel im the biggest jerk on the planet earth i smacked a girl
then screamed icp in this bitch how do fuckin magnets work
cause youre attractive but we aint attractable hate to be dramatical but im not romantical
its tragical thinkin some magical shits gonna happen that aint practical
cause me and loves like a bad combination i keep them feelings locked in a vault so its safe to say im uncrackable
full body armor bitch you just need a helmet cause if you think you special youre retarded
thinkin youre one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
youre a trainwreck i gotta one track mind and shorty youre fine but you sorta remind me of a 49er
cause youve been a gold digger since you was a miner
been tryin ta hunt me down like a dog cause youre on my ass but you cant get a cent
only women that i love are my daughters but sometimes i rhyme
and it sounds like i forget im a father and i push it farther so father forgive me if i forget to draw the line
its apparent i shouldnt have been parent ill never grow up so to hell with your parents and mother fuck father time
it aint never gonna stop a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
poured my halfempty glass in a cup now my cup has runneth over
and im about to set it on you like a muthafuckin coaster
white americas mirror so dont feel awkward or weird
if you stare at me and see yourself cause youre one too shouldnt be a shock be
now this shits about to kick off this party looks wack
lets take it back to straight hiphop and start it from scratch
im bout to bloody this track up everybody get back
thats why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the raag
just like i did with addiction im bout to kick it
been public enemy since you thought pe was gym bitch
so turn the volume loud cause its mayhem til the am
so baby make just like kfed and let yourself go let yourself go
so everybody everybody go berserk shake your body
guess its just the way that im dressed aint it
khakis pressed nike shoes crispy and fresh laced so i guess it aint
that aftershave or cologne that made em just faint
plus i showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
but girl your bodys banging jump me in dang bangbang
so come get on this kids rock baw with da baw dangdang
aint slowing it down throw in the towel toweltowel
question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
so turn the volume loud cause its mayhem til the am
so crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go let yourself go
so everybody everybody go berserk shake your body
and they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
all i know is i fell asleep and woke up in that monte carlo
but i done did enough codeine to knock future into tomorrow
but i am trying to find a way to get you aloan car note
shit head with a potty mouth get the bar of soap lathered
i aint called anybody baby since birdman unless youre a swallow
word rick word man you heard but dont get discouraged girl
look i was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
if that means what i think it means were in trouble
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
but for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while im practicing that
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
for the wack while im masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah
cause im beginning to feel like a rap god rap god
let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard that hard
and did nothing but shoot for the moon since ppeeyoom
only hall of fame ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
youre witnessing a massoccur like youre watching a church gathering
and a way to go from your label every day looking boy
of keeping up with the same pace looking boy cause
the way im racing around the track call me nascar nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god
kneel before general zod this planets krypton no asgard asgard
somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle
maybe try to help get some people through tough times
rappers are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime
but i still rap like im on my pharoahe monch grind
one when i tried to say ill take seven kids from columbine
morphin into an immortal coming through the portal
youre stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though
so ray j went straight to radio station the very next day
uh summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming im a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you im superhuman
innovative and im made of rubber so that anything you say is
how to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating
never fading and i know that haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off theyll be celebrating
while im ripping any one of these verses that versus you
i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to
theyre asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i had
then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then
its a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas
if science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
whos likely to become a serial killer case of tourettes
i make a mess as the day progresses angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
like this is how ill cut your face up bitches with these hedge trimmin scissors with razor edges
the only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation i guess
cause i feel like a little bitch this predicaments
despicable im sick of just getting pushed its ridiculous
i look like a freakin wuss a pussy this kid just took
my stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
this fucker was twelve and was six foot with a vicious hook
he hit me i fell i got back up all i did was book now theres using your head
if you had a brain youd be dangerous a brain youd be dangerous
mama im a grow one day to be famous and im a be a pain in the anus
im a use my head as a weapon find a way to escape this insaness
mama always said son if you had a brain youd be dangerous guess it pays to be brainless
fast forward some years later a teenager this is fun sweet
ive accomplished they stomped me into the mud gee for what reason you stumped me
but how do you get the shit beat outta you beat down and be up beat when you dont have nothing
no valid shot at life chance to make it or succeed
cause youre doomed from the start its like you grew up on jump street from jump street
in a trance locked in my room yeah but i got some plans mama
these damn rhymes are failin outta my pants pocket i cant stop it
in school this shit helps for sure im gettin more self assured then ive ever been before
plus no one picks on me anymore i done put a stop to that threw my first punch end of story
still in my skulls a vacant empty void been usin it more as a bin for storage
in this gourde theres a ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword
not to mention four linchpins an astringent stored
ironin board a bench a wrench a ore wench an attention whore
everything but a brain but domes off the fuckin chain like an independent store
just think if i had a brain in it thank god that i dont cause id probably be dahmer cause mama always said
i told you one day i said theyd have that red carpet rolled out yo
now everywhere i go they scream out go im bout to clean house yo
out sold the sellouts freak the hell out middle america hear em yell out in terror they were so scared and those kids
just about belted out whatever spouted or fell out my smart aleck mouth it was so weird
motherfukin difficult yeah til then hopefully ya
its ok to be scaredstraight they said i provoked queers
a stroke of sheer genius smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes yeah
who the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole emceed
be able to take the whole culture and reupholstery it
and boy they did flock cant believe this little hick locked
this hiphop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got
that white trash traffic in gridlock shit hoppin like six blocks
from a kid rock insane clown posse concert in mid october
and god forbid i see the wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium yall cause
you used to say that id never be nothing without you
and id cry and id scream baby please dont leave
before i met you ill bet you ill be just fine without you
til i woke up to discover that that dream was dead
it was almost a homicide that you caused cause i was so traumatized
it was you and i why did i think it was ride or die
its like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
other side of my back and stuck a spike too shouldve
held my chin up finally showed a sign of life in me for the
first time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
but youre never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
took it on the chin like a champ so dont lump me in with the chumpions
it was november 31st today wouldve been our anniversary
i wrote it on a calender was gonna call but couldnt think of the words to say
but they came to me just now so i put em in a verse to lay
and i thank you uh cause you made me uh a better person than i was
and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy
for wanting my cake and eat it too and wanting it both ways
cause all i wanted to do is be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink used it as a tool when i blew steam wooh
ironic cause i think im getting so huge i need a shrink
now i aint much of a poet but i know somebody once told me
cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
so i keep conjuring sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
no wonder youre losing your mind the way it wanders
cause the very thing that i loves killing me and i cant conquer it
im just relaying what the voice in my heads saying
dont shoot the messenger im just friends with the
one day that id walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and im coming straight at
take you back to the days that id get on a dre track

a fuckin romantic i fuckin love you you fuckin bitch combative possessive in fact last time i was mad at an ex
i actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
i said hit the road then after she left i sent that bitch a text
that said be careful driving dont read this and have an accident  she glanced to look at it and wrecked
too bad thought we had a connect no sense dwelling makes
never been a more compelling case than the model covered in loreal and mace
who fell from grace eleven stories for story telling while the whore was yelling rape
till her vocal chords were swelling and her voice was more horser than tori spellings face
of my fancy estates to greet norman bates with a warm embrace
less your andrea yates dont ask me for a date though youre late well the sentiments great
its mainly cause of the game of wait dinner at eight
never thinking about who what i said hurt in what verse
though far be it from you to be calm our house was vietnam
desert storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
that gift from me up under the christmas tree dont mean shit to me
youre kicking me out its 15 degrees and its christmas eve little prick just leave
ma let me grab my fucking coat anything to have each others goats
were in the same fucking boat youd think that itd make us close nope
further away it drove us but together headlights shine a car full of belongings
still got a ways to go back to grandmas house its straight up the road
and i was the man of the house the oldest so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
then nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
and thats when i realized you were sick and it wasnt fixable or changeable
and to this day we remained estranged and i hate it though but
cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though
cause you aint even get to witness your grand babies grow
but im sorry mama for cleaning out my closet at the time i was angry
rightfully maybe so never meant that far to take it though
cause now i know its not your fault and im not making jokes
that song i no longer play at shows and i cringe every time its on the radio
and im way too old to cry the shit is painful though
all you did all you said you did your best to raise us both
foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours
but i love you debbie mathers oh what a tangled web we have
fuck it i guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
but id have flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
someone ever moved them from me that you coulda bet your asses
if i had to come down the chimney dressed as santa kidnap them
you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
and as you left i had this overwhelming sadness come over me
and im mad i didnt get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad
so mom please accept this as a tribute i wrote this on the jet
the stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt i guess were crashing
so if im not dreaming i hope you get this message that ill always love you from afar
but i think i think the lines are starting to get blurry
i feel like mace when he gave up the game for his faith
i feel like im caged in these chains and restraints
grimming every stranger in the place while i gaze into space
i need a change of pace cause the pace im working at is dangerous
theres nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
i done quit chicken heads in cold turkey and started slowly roasting em
fuck your feelings i feel like i play for the saints
then aim for all these fake kanyes jays waynes and the drakes
im frustrated cause aint no more nsync now im all out of whack
im all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack
im going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
im strapped for battle suckaduck crawl out the back its a bar fight
prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air
you done called every woman a slut but you forgetting sarah marshall palin
and next time i show up to court ill be naked and just wear a lawsuit
judge be like thats sharp how much that motherfucker cost you
youre so fucking gravy marshall i should start calling you au jus
cause alls you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
i believe people can change but only for the worse
i couldve changed the world if it wasnt for this verse
cause theyre worse when theyre reversed motherfucker
wild ever since the day i came out i was like merits fuck that
from the first album even the gals were like tight lyrics dreamy eyes
and from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
and that sort of defines where im at and the way i feel now
feel like i might just strike first and ignore the replies
then i step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin
nah f with christina i aint fucking with either jessica neither
simpson or alba my albums just sicker than struck with the fever
get the chloraseptic excedrin aleve or extra strength tylenol 3s
bedroom ever again like the legend of heather ledger
get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver
ever since 19946 dresden it was definitely my destiny
i just wanted to skip school and rap used to mop floors
flip burgers and wash dishes while i wrote rhymes trying to get props for em
since nwa was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
and i got an evil twin so who the fuck you think thats 3rd and that 4th spots for
and im nuts then again who the fuck wants to plain eminem
but no ones insaner than slim look at that evil grin evil twin
look whos back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
guess thats why im an addict and its just small up there
cause im so sick of being the truth i wish someoned finally admit me
i sound like im trying to sing the fucking chorus to hip hop hooray
and a base whether were fucking of that instead of your face so
what you think im looking for romance cause im lonely
change that tune you aint got remote chance to control me
as it used to be when i first introduced yall to my skittish side
imma make you wanna punch out some fuckin one ouch
scream life as i punch counter and bunches out of anger
nothings riding on it but your pride is all youre fighting for
you pick yourself back up you dust your jacket off
pull out your pants for whooping ass and flash it on em
no ones more ignorant then you fuckin four in the morning youre at the laboratory storming
mcs you better consider this a formal warning youre in for it
girl what would you do if i said your body was off the chain
and i told you i smile every single time i saw your face
sugar ray leonard wouldnt sugar coat a fucking booger though
nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
beating himself in the head til russell lets him off deaf jam
theres nothing on this fucking earth better than being
how much that cost thats what i call the cost to splurge
you drive me bonkers im about to get my swerve on for sure
thought i was pimpin til i felt like nas the first
date cause i think i gave you power when i gave you flowers in a vase
a box of chocolates throat lozengers cough drops and certs
probably shouldve never let me call that job of yours
to talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
shouldve been one of the first signs to cause alert
man we jumped in too fast cause since then i just cant be apart from her
cause nobodys bodys awesomer i lust it and she loves me
you know this aint love you know this aint love what is it then
its desperation shes looking for mr right wants me to be that guy to her
its desperation i cant even put up a fight cause i give in at the sight of her
you were obviously oblivious to me i swore i was just invisible to you
cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
now im in disbelief i never knew that this could be such misery ah
cause now you see nothing but me and i dont see nothing but you
do anything individually which is to cling on scared to be alone
cant specifically describe it i just cant seem to give a reason
this definitive just need you talking bout i live and breathe you
put me in a situation in which its both i wish to seek
just want you to myself dont wanna share you with no one else
i think our relationship it seems to be on the fritz
games behind your frame of mind aint the same as mine
i think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too
thats a negative alicia i will never give the keys up
to the crib ever again no reason not even a gift certificate from tiffanys
you better have an epiphany slut guess what the lease up
you were using me for loot like i used you for looks
toots used to be my carrie underwood i was your lumberjack
but i cant stomach this im leaving you im not coming back
she said the fuck with that wheres my louisville slugger at
she grabbed that fucking bat and swung it at my head
when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice steel toe
girl probably coulda put a 100yard field goal through the uprights
what is a nightmare the dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream a nightmare
i used to think i had bad luck but i wasnt superstitious
till one day i grew suspicious when i stepped on a crack on aunt ednas stoop
then we flew the coop to michigan to start a new beditching
so we moved back to missouri from michigan from missouri back to michigan
someone put me out my misery i cant do this again
discipline last thing i wanna do is listen shes like
so the walls and i done lost my power to see through them bitches
and one day uncle ronnie brought over this new but different
music into the picture and it became my new religion
move back to michigan again to live with my grandma ned
i say it to this day if you aint listened to the wizard
id zone out with my headphones all i remember doings wishing
for shoes fuck them stupid pumas bitch its all about them new edition troops
made that final maneuver to 8 mile and hoover and somehow i saw my future is in this
when i sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin
couldnt wait to play him my new shit hed go coocoo ballistic
we touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit
if we all band together there aint no stopping this shit
if you got dissed at the shop cause if they caught you slippin
theyd take your spot if someone got to rippin you
but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
and the truth hurts shit no wonder youre sore losers
ooh no more tripping in bird shit songs of self empowerment surgeon
words of encouragement but this discouraging the rappers
the rap games god but the names not james todd im just a wordsmith
cause all i got is bars for you dumbbells since yours aint working out
and you aint got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast to get served
you blonde dumb hoes all i got is dick for you to come blow on
so stop the show but i need a drum roll fore i go on
im a juggernaut you do not wanna crumble you bambacluts
so mow the fucking lawn your asses are blades of grass
whos just to make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove soot
and the next thing i know something came crawling up from below
so grab a hand yall cause you may see if i popped your head
but the white flesh creatures trail is easily followed
there before that shimmering veil of light the ivory skin slug thing
you wake in its wake to start the mourning process
stopped to inhale cant even tell your nose is stuffed
steer through life sometimes you might not wanna swerve
and threw dirt on your casket but youve returned from the ashes
and that hurt that you have you just converted to gasoline
and while youre burning the past standing in the inferno and chant
youre so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
it happens all the time they take your heart and steal your life
and im pullin for you to push through this feeling
you may even feel so good that youre willing to forgive em even after
all the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building
and the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
youre sealed in but youre fireproof flame retardant you withstood it
and as you climb up to the roof youre just chillin you look down
you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
but wounds wounds heal but scars still remain the same
so feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire
its like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
i have learned from fighting fights that werent mine
guess i got a way with words i could get away with murder
80 degree day and theres no fricken air conditioning
and imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping
my ass from a hole in the ground still cant tell em apart
came straight out the trailer park screaming im proud
to this day i still get in fights with the same broad
youre ass backwards like motherfucking bob and silent jay
whens the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
while i sashayed around flames with a match and i gave him the gas face
and this aint got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot
but by the way thoughts are getting darker by the day
im a combination of skylar grey tyler the creator and violent j
paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face im insane
every rhyme i say sons you like an ultra violet ray
im selling hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat
im throwin down the gauntlet to see what hell i can raise
with the rhyme im spittin while im shittin on competition
i done said so much fucked up shit i was born a mistake
i had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
slaughter tracks i done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
cause that cougars a milf shes the oldest trick in the book
make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
and im sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole sorry another catchphrase
but your baggage aint gonna fit in my storage overhead space
cause it just aint big enough to fit your damaged goods
other words dont try to put your heart in a headcase
i keep on falling down no wonder you cant stand me i need my cane
if you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain
told these hoes shut their pie holes now peep my game
im nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
and hi ho hand me my shovel im liable to dig my hole
deeper and its off to he double hockey sticks i go
ohh please be empty please be empty please be empty
im gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
and lay with 18 guys naked and let myself show let myself show
demonic sinister ever since the the doc replenished me
the day he gave me that shot when i was just bout to quit
so to not see him with me would be a shocking image
and knock me to the canvas even the boxing critics
know that if i get off to a rocky start ill always have a rocky finish
but i hope i offended you when i told ya how dope i am at this
and put emphasis on the dope so when names come up
in that conversation of whos the dopest better throw mine in it
you wont find anywhere where it fires and i unload my pen explodes
let insults fly even sixty seconds that go by so you know i meant it
two pairs of jeans id alternate bummy clothes i member
begging my mom for kmart macgregors cause they were new
st vincent de paul those ponys were used and no size fitted
they said i was a gimmick now im the one that those guys mimic
now you fuckers dont wanna go starting no argument
cause you know ill win it name a flow thats more authentic and dont front
rest in piece to big proof you was a beast you lyrically mirrored me
molded my flow off of you your spirits flowing through me
i love you doody without you i feel so incomplete
im no king no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
better watch the fucking tone that you speak feel like im in the zone
im in a whole different league on my mothafuckin own its just me
no opponents can compete and ive never been known to retreat
from beef beepbeep follow trends or wallow in defeat
im still hungry as fuck but cant even say bon appetit
cause i dont know what to eat fucking microphone or the beat
its nose to the grindstone time holmes your minds blown
cause i rhyme like im still trying to get signed up in the ebony show
case with denaun screaming who the fuck passed you the mic
i ever meet my match imma strike that bitch first
cause on the mic i gotta represent the real rappers
the real rappers get their mothafuckin skills cracking
before i signed with the doc i almost signed with duck down
cause rawkus didnt make no offers so mothafuck loud
rubbing it and holding some grudge now but dont front
late at night used to catch a buzz couldnt write
its hard to decipher what cypher i might jump into tonight
cause im hyper or something needing someone or something is lighting
this fire under me its breathing new life its like i already died once
i guess some people only live twice and its funny
my days of being broke was so long ago i lost my concept of money
im having a stroke of genius elizabeth im coming to you honey
from boy to man its still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland
im in another category man dont put me up with them pop stars
i never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy band
no offense yes offense precedents has been set thatll never get met
but never forget that im the one you thought wouldnt make it
got a whole generation of rappers coming up that are nutty with the flow
an mc since me whos this good with the fucking mincing of words
without mincing words thatll make you feel like im pinching a nerve
whose mentally disturbed you might as well stick a knife in me and turn
id battle that til my own recollection remembers these words
im liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
i disgust you like dialogue from the shop to the wired frog
night club shit i was taught if your cds on fire
you had to put it out yourself like highland park no fire department
a martyr on a private charter whose life could be harder
widely regarded highly bite me sweetheart im slightly retarded
but tonight im starting shit im feeling self righteous
i might just hop in a mosh pit on some mike tyson and pac shit
ill fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
toxic hands are arsenic flammable bars examine the content
i bet you they ring a bell when i come back and im conscious
stole a magnum box and bag cirocs in back of a datsun
no underwear grasping a bayer aspirin and dropped it
air max in my closet preposterous nikes made out of ostrich
of a rhinoceros possum skin giraffe and a dolphin
swatch watches and sneakers matches with the parkers
with all these trainers but i dont have any boxers
and im standing here naked hangover still wasted
yo why does it always sound like im grabbing my nostrils
until the mannequin doll scatter and the inanimate objects
cause i hear the track and im starting to get fucking amped
imma spark plug im like the car with the cables hooked up to my fucking back im a duracell
but i sure as hell got it backwards cause yall could get jumped
ill push a bitch into oncoming traffic just watch this
see how mad you act when i drop you off at saks fifth ave
thatll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
its like a magic wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
if ronda rousey was on the couch with the condoms out
ill laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
and all i see is paulie malign now shes slaughterhouse in a blouse
and madonna with mud on her god dammit i am misogynist
i slap linda ronstadt with a lobster throw her off a balcony
half you assholes aint strong enough to pick up a spirit
klepto im back to rip shop up but my thing is this now
been rapping so long ive been killing this shit its easy
kidnapping your mom cause im still in this bitch thievery
ransom for jonbenét ramsey chandra levy and gary condit
em paul was scared that if i went back to the blonde
perhaps ill launch some cracker taunts at action bronson
and record a wack response to kendrick lamars control verse
it takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
is it the fact that im a walking talking actual quadruple entendre
still get along with this voice cause thats the monster
so dosido with a sociopath everyone who knows me knows that
what they dont know is the fact rihanna calls me pinocchio meh
so am ia wooh cappadonna cut the track off fart sound
put the basket back while the bath salt packets are gone i
got slash on guitar splashing bizarre thrasher and aerosmith
and im a spectacular archer feed count dracula chocula
bandwagoners im kicking the damn stragglers off and im strangling em
im gettin sick and tired of always apologizing to you
i didnt do shit to deserve what youre puttin me through
i saw my lord jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
just so you dont die alone just so you dont die alone
guess i gotta deal with the fact that you aint never comin back
useless rather pick up the phone not at all followin protocol
no balls and go to call to talk forget what i want to say
im sick of playin these games i cant handle this heartbreak
hang up the phone and i shake i think i may have made a mistake
im havin all these visions of us at each others wakes
in caskets and suddenly i wake and thats when i know i
just so you dont die alone just so you dont die alone
and its been a while now but i finally realize how
much reality sucks but its just something about our love
im still in denial now dealing with the finality of it
and its making me crazy thinking of the days we spent
with these clouded memories and i cant seem to get you out it
completely deep and madly head over heels for you
it was supposed to be us but you crushed the dream
we was supposed to die together and its killing me so much
from the day the song called hi my name is dropped
the media made me the equivalent of a modernday genghis khan
it was ingrained in me that i wouldnt amount to a shitstain i thought
no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
i just wanna play my part should i make waves or not
so back and forth in my brain the tugowar wages on
i dont wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform i was raised upon
and have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
and your only outfit so you know theyre gonna talk about it
better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
feel like ive already said this a kabillion eighty times
how many times can i say the same thing different ways that rhyme
what i really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story
bet cha feel the same way i felt when i was in the same place you are
i know what its like i was there once single parents
hate your appearance did you struggle to find your place in this world
but it wasnt until i put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
and there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain ive caused
and the window is closing and theres nowhere else that i can go with flows
and im frozen cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song
but id rather make not afraid 2 than make another motherfucking we made you uh
and i dont wanna seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs
gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use thatll make ya strong
enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt
cause i cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
least i made it out ta that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
so this is for every kid who alls they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
i represent him or her anyone similar you are the reason that i made this song
and everything youre scared to say dont be afraid to say no more
take it with a grain of salt and eat their fuckin faces off
the legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when im gone
another day another hotel the inside of its nice though
cause i will say some inspirational shit in a real way
fucked up shit in the world and tell it to suck the dick
stuck on the fence on a balance beam if i seem unbalanced
its challenging but my conscience allows me to think
the most foulish childish things without even blinking
without even thinkin about all the stinkin amounts of people that seem to be reachin in the crowds
cause this vanity surrounded by all these lights yeah
i said this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit
from in this house its quite bare but it aint when you cant leave it
but its like i payed the price of fame twice i hate it
so i bitch about my life then make another song its a cycle aint it
you dont even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier
cant even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when ive been
sucks sometimes i just wanna walk in target and look at shit browse i dont even want to buy nothin
look how excited i sound when i get to talkin bout life and
put a thousand lighters in the sky for the outsidaz
and i been thinkin bout the time i slept on the floor at the outhouse
pharmaceuticals glue stick to crucify me at bonnaroo
but i dont know if im in tennessee chicago or houston
alcoholic too plus im on lean like the tower of pisa
cause i just thought i just heard jay electronica and odd futures new shit
after i finish polishing off this bottle of booze i got a solution
concentrated like orange juice so im not as diluted
its mouth waterin too so i walked up to it like im marshall
i mean verbal assault that i use to smoke all of you losers
got a bazooka a shotgun a ruger a glock and a nuke
im not coming to repair your fuckin electronic computers
im tore up demolished a fuckin stone like oliver
the box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
right for me will change me rearrange my head to be
just right for you and me dont laugh please listen
thats why im actually trapped in this shoving match
i can keep getting my ass kicked keep it coming back
last time i tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
an elastic bungee strap proper plaster a thumb tack
on a nasa shuttle flap fuckin snapped the rudder in half
and i go grab my gogogadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress
and thats more likely than finding someone thats
while i was away i know probably some of you got to thinkin
youre top ten aint cha stop cause you fuckers are talkin crazy
and stop interrupting youre not even up in the conversation
underground pop or nameless whatever your job is
the oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
fuckin mcdonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle
jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration
but i shit you not like im fucked up with constipation
that day will come before i stumble upon some ladies
tell em if they want it they can come get that static
i swear i love my city i just want a little static
see me they salute me they aint ready for that static
i took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
and now things changin a lot he fuck with my authority
he definitely is bout it its retail fraud hes sweet
the trigger finger round the diamond tester we tell flaw with heat
ridin round shootin my biopic and my autobiography
you thinkin makeup we thinkin lark voorhies face
the twin eagles ol air his coup might as well ride by in the ambulance
lettin somebody just live inside of your head rent free
yall niggas been bitches thats none of my business but i dont sip tea
all we knows is pitfalls thats why hes always climbin out his drop
boy i need no halfs a half i want the game in entirety
dont worry man those bullets will still be at your ass firin
i still call it safe i would suck if i was umpiring
boy hit the beat  just treat that shit like its a diary
im offended if you hear my new shit and you aint rewindin me
self made ive never needed your bail or a wire see
ha plus im so loyal that that paper boys is all that i fetch
if the the ball in my hand then the ball in the net
im over respected my mama gated communitys over protective
used to put 50 on the layaway now my closet 50 shades of grey
twenty six and i done lived a life time a few times
in church tryin to get a little savings yeah coupon
now the stakes high niggas surprised at the new lines
takin down my number like you still aint got a new line
i know it took way longer than nine months but fuck it its all in due time
i turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein a beatle though
dont want to i need to gotta learn to keep it cerebral
when you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but aint peaceful
comin from them streets where they thirsty starvin to eat
just a step away from failin thats why they call it the d
honestly no honor roll but honored up in them streets
cause im a linwood nigga them young niggas hit ya
put a stack on your head youll bleed a lake on grand river
if you think your hood harder then i might beg to differ
know some killas pull the trigger for a swisher and miller
if the blicka hit ya kisser bet yo ass not remembering
they say my citys tougher than two fat bitches scissorin
had ks in front ya school but i aint going to ketteran
and they used to use my mother fuckin trailer to tease me with
mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller
and if i ever end up escapin the streets i swear that i would stay here
break all of my friends out of here and take em straight to the mercedes dealer
peel off back to the same block that we came from on a rampage to crazy
whats makin you think i need a switch cause im adrian peterson
when hes raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
but jesus i can see just why people quit callin me to do features
i wasnt me i probably wouldnt wanna play with me neither shit
mcs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of swedish fish
and for the record you dont want this type of static in your life
may consider tryin to reinsulate ya windows may be in or another crazy winter
cause so cold in the d it is as days begin to tick away
but aint this really what made me into the angry bitter blond
im yankin your chain a bit or maybe the way in which im sayin shit
and its still the same shit and shadys still a lady killer
since the day i went insane and then attacked the babysitter
with the potato peeler mushed her face into the entertainment center
its like another plane just entered into ukraine again
the bermuda triangle and attempted to make a safe descent
awaiting anyone who aint affiliated it could be danger
did you make arrangements with the gangsters for you came here
what up though its the godfather trick trick you either ridin with us or gettin rolled on that means detroit vs everybody hey em let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood let the little homies get this remix crackin
an hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand it passes through it
if i can grasp it and just control what happens to it
then i can trap it so no more time elapses through it
then i could try to channel it through cadillacs and buicks
to transmit through em to make you put your ass into it
and thats when you hit the roof because you cant sit through it
your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it
and as you do it your movements become fast and fluent
youre mashin to it moshing until youre black and bluish
youre acting foolish this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion
true its chaotic but its got your body moving as a unit
uniting together tonight so make it last and you better just
this moment we own it we wont never let it go go
you better move yourself cause tomorrows ass can wait
there is no time to sit there and procrastinate you better
cause when we descend together we begin to move as one
illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum
but if you could lose it once i mean if you could let shit go
to make em feel the feeling that im feeling right this minute
cause i feel like the night wont end til i get finished
so close the shades makin sure no light gets in it
the skys the limit tonight because the nights infinite
a high percentage of black people and white mixed in it
but no one really gives a fuck cause they just like whats spinnin
his life was spinnin the whole entire night just spinnin
like lifes beginning so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin in it
with the vile polish politics by the way im higher than the eiffel tower tip
i like writing but i will stick this pencil in your ass before i bite ya shit
pause inhale hell n kush us and yealwolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
felons crooks going door to door like hes selling books dolly parton style melons mush
if you could swallow my style you probably rip ya pants off
if you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
itd probably smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
leave you niggas floating in water and go and drown a fish
fuck im fucking heinous ill make you fucking famous
bitch its thundering cause im hushing up im a storm if you wonderin
shit you could muster up a thought to take a toter and a brain fart
want urine in your face all you had to do was say it
you wish you woulda just stayed pissed off in the first place
alls we know is you over the bar like limbolimbaugh
so quit fucking the dark before we start callin you bizaare
and as for these hoes who dont know me from a can of paint
you must be huffin fuck a ballsack if the taints cant take you on a date
you mistake me for a gentleman your 2000 and late man williaint
im the bad guy type of guy that will drag 5 girls up on stage
pour ice in their pants and the first one who pees gets a black eye
puffing loosies watching i love lucy with gary busey
will there ever come a day when they could slay me
i dont know fifth month black and yellow insect maybe
nickle i just picked up a phantom look how it rolls royce
you should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
here to kill you pussys dont ask what we came for
definitively finish you my fist stick out that eyeball
you step to us text rugers to respect the shooters
move to the beat of the same drum without lex luger
cheated death multiple times without riggin the deck
therell be blood everywhere you be laying on the louboutin floor
its raw you keep acting like you dont know mouse nigga
cause after i spill you at the light you be in a car pool
keep your distance from idiots cause the truth told
they food for thoughts rotten they gems are fools gold
need results from my actions mistakes ill exonerate
im martin king staring at a picture of obamas face
i dont need the key to the game i pick a mean lock
takeoff you invited inside of the mind of a psychotic rhymer
now rappers are lining up jackers im climbing up ladders
i buy enough clappers to retire you factors fire at drama
but read me wrong get my gun and split you to particles particles
not only heir to the throne but my chair is suspended in air
you got us pegged wrong my circle dont fit in with squares
you frauds just blow hard like broads i coast guard the west
getting head like clean clippers with haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
you think you seen sick well bitch you aint seen sicker
then ill crack and then ill hop around in a hospital gown
popping the trunk my pumper stay cocking the round
shit they think im illuminati so fuckin ignorant
but when you win they say you a sin but in the end
they jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
skinnyass pants sagging its only yourself you playing
call me a clown but you love where the clowns hanging
and the freakshows at the county carnival then you pay
im getting paid for these shows that i throw lately
same shows a year ago woulda broken most of you crazies
bitch you crazy cause you quit look at my clique lately
you aint fucking wit budden you aint got no choice with royce
you dont wanna see the crooked i well listen to ortiz voice
and if marshall want me to clap then homie i deploy
looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
and smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
you probably think that im a negative person dont be so sure of it
can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again
fuck it you only live once you might as well die now
warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board
eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
to receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
storing the dead bodies in grandmas little basement
to perform an autopsy on you while you scream im still alive
driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
and pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
fuck an acid tab ill strap the whole sheet to my forehead
wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
and im as good at keeping a promise as nostradamus
im doing drivebys in tinted corvettes on vietnam war vets
you probably gonna think that im talking about you and you goddamn right i am
nah im just playing tug of war with his heart cause he misses me
i can still fuck him and leave him whenever i feel frisky
and theres no risk of disease cause he aint with anyone is he
strapped him to the front seat missing all the front teeth
thinking to herself whens the next time hes gonna punch me
and once she does shell be stuffed up in a trunk
fuck around get dumped up in a lake fore you dump me
you thought you had me till my shrink told me this
i keep dumping bodies in the lake imma get caught and sent up the river
how do i know she aint gonna kill me when i sleep
i shriek every time she hands me something to drink
sex kept us together when we slept together everything
she go to the club and not answer the phone when i call her
thats growing smaller and that was just a while ago
what was i supposed to do call her out on it we just argue
say she put it down on purpose and flipped the whole script
she thought she had me till my shrink told me this
sometimes its hard enough just dealing with real life
and show these people what my level of skills like
world on my shoulders as i run back to this 8 mile road
once im over these tracks man ima never look back
8 mile road and im gone i know right where im going
only way that i know how to escape from this 8 mile road
im walking these train tracks trying to regain back
sits in front of the tv buries her nose in the pad
and just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
while she colors her big brother and mother and dad
aint no telling what really goes on in her little head
wish i could be the daddy that neither one of us had
but i keep running from something i never wanted so bad
its like i grew up but i aint grow me two nuts yet
the pressures too much man im just trying to do whats best
that i dont pray to the sky please im begging you god
please dont let me be pigeon holed in no regular job
yo im telling you dawg im balling this trailer tomorrow
tell my mother i love her kiss baby sister goodbye
you gotta live it to feel it you didnt you wouldnt get it
or see what the big deal is why it wasnt the skillest
to be walking this borderline of detroit city limits
a certificate of authenticity youd never even see
sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
but when it comes crunch time where do my punchlines go
cause i aint having no luck with this little rabbits foot fuck it
maybe i need a new outlet im starting to doubt shit
plus i feel like im on stuck in this battling mode
from each one of my limbs by each one of my friends
its enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
sometimes i feel like a robot sometimes i just know not
sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid i dont got
like i already got the beat all i need is the words
time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 mile road
yo its time to get rid of this coward once and for all
im sick of the motherfucker check this shit out
that makes me believe you really dont have a interest in living
you think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say

i was praying that you and me might end up together
with a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes
and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it
say im living too fast dont plan on changing my pace
got one foot on the gas its never a need for brakes
smoke ezriders with hash fuck bitches from out of state

and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
shucks im an alcoholic and thats all i can say
i call in to work cause all i do is frolic and play
of tylenol 3 and talk about how violent ill be rrarrrrh
i strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
my daughter scribbled over that rhyme i couldnt read it
im polishing gold waiting for this drama to unfold
i cock back put the toast in the holster and froze
but im gonna put thirty inside him and leave early
i put the gun to his head and this is what he said
you never met me and youll probably never see me again
but i know you  the names slim  you want revenge
im telling the truth i got a price on my head too cause when you
my shit went bang but it only fired a blank he said
i figured he was telling the truth thats why i didnt shoot
some old dude hes got 26 plaques and he already sold two
lets shoot him in his kneecaps hell never see it coming
but he aint got no legs they cut em off at the stomach
and we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
i could hear somebody singin  it sounded like a g thang
thats when i seen dre in trouble and came with the gauge
i say the worlds already fucked im just addin to it
they say im suicidal teenagers newest idol cmon
ima sit on top of the world im here and shit on brandy and mase
im scarier than a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill ahh
but with a lot funnier plot and people that feel me
cause ima still be madd rapper whether i got money or not yup

otherwise i might get sent up backstrike in a ford
and you wonder what the fuck i need more vicadin for
everybodys pissin me off even the no limit tank

im the illest rapper to hold the cordless patrollin corners
im meaner in action than roscoe beatin james todd sr
across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments ow ow ow
with a fucked up childhood that i used as an excuse
you probably think that im a negative person dont be so sure of it
i dont promote violence i just encourage it cmon
as i fall down a cement flight of steps ahhhhhhhh

shit why not blow your brain out im blowin mine out
fuck it you only live once you might as well die now
my laser disc gon make you take a razor to your wrist
make you satanistic make you take the pistol to your face
your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
i got one little girl and hailey jade is shadys business
and shadys just an alias i made to make you pissed off
where the fuck were you when gil was paid to make me dishwash
i make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
you made me get a bigger attitude than eighty kim scotts
and she almost got the same fate that gradys bitch got
i knew that just the two of us would make you hate me this much
and just the two of us that aint got shit to do with us
so you can call me a punk a pervert or a chauvinist pig
but the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch
put a brick inside that xerox when i print em a page
all i got is zs they sleeping on me i cant get em awake
i spoon feed them the sound in a room full of deceivers and clowns
who believe they making it rain cause all they see is the clouds
like a potato with a bunch of meatheads like fuck it
but before you can pick a pepper you better pick up your heater
its like putting nikes on a cheetah betta speed up
say im from the new school ima say check ya tone and watch ya mouth
if they teaching how to dougie im condoning dropping out
i just perfected being hip hops foster child now check it
i dont blame yall for being trash fans and copping it
the radios the crime scene the masses are the hostages
in my youth id throw shots the fan would dodging it
im grown i aint watching the throne im sabotaging it
you see that four headed monster and the storm looms
snipe em from a distance the scope got a long zoom
got a figure here you wont get bigger if you on shrooms
enough raps from you scrub cats about cocking a snub back
but i got this shit from uptown she my summer bunny
thats why the haters of every kind wanna send me llamas
i made it right before they eyes like i was benihanas
magical walk with the black ball way i bounce off the asphalt with cat paws
glass jaw hoody and mask would be the black folk with no passport
body be found in the mansion in one of my trap doors
probably be that of awards tween michael rappaport and kenny lattimore
if it died you other crews wouldnt survive the smell
i spot a victim the plotll thicken when the clock is tickin
i caught em slippin i gotta give em a shot i hit em with proper spittin
hottest writtens and compositions so competitions a contradiction
somebody mentioned they got it crooked highly fiction
the sickest lyric kicker diggin a ditch for different spitters
my mind so deadly its just like the beanie is close to a holster
its over control my whole coastal region like im supposed to
give me a beat to kill too many people still eating sleeping pills
before you die you should do the jada and leave a will
killers yall become when yall rhyme i salute and dap
and if i blink then remove ya snaps you aint cool you wack
with ya foolish yacs skinny jeans dont mean ya ass shoot
dont play like tyler perry this the slaughterhouse of pain
when it comes to sixteens im a fiend feinding a studio
near a needle with a mean lean probably writing bars to nas thief theme
getting my yaowa on may all the olajuwons be the dream team
and you gotta know why i made the cut im puerto rican
and tryna put me outs like tryna steal a transvestite from eddie
you tell me you love my music again we go together
thousand dollar frames i prefer to see the world through
dont ask me nothing bout budden i beat my girl too

thats why i ride around in a rolls like wiz khalifa do
rappers im your daddy i tell you straight as this
you dont kill but your father will like jaden smith
or ima have to run like de la hoya in drag when cameras come
smack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom
while im cyber sexing with jessica alba via skype
we cornered the market like a walmart in a culdesac
yeah this what 2 million singles sold and a album thats gold
ayo lyrical miracle spiritual individual criminal subliminal
when i unleash these beastly hoards on your cd stores
wanna stop it you gon need a priest and at least three swords
a license to ill from the beastie boys 3 ouija boards
and a squeegee and please be warned dont ask for the squeegees for
or the holy water acid rap thatll eat these floors
and as for me you ask when im gone will he be mourned
can that chick fit a newborn dead baby inside a freakin shoebox
with a shoehorn smothered in chloroform so she can go get her groove on
tell joe i need his empty box from his old shell toe adidas
you just put your six inch heel through my benz windshield
and drink like a hick redneck hillbilly will till he gets hiccups
fresh outta the mental hospital and me not flossing a middle finger
while i hop in a mosh pit will be like nas doing gospel or rb you crazy
as if flashing across the news posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
with a huge johnson boobs and a monstrous tube of lube
and a bra some boots some panties in an aqua blue mazda
sneakin in through the back door fruity mcs get ambushed
rammed and squooshed slammed and pushed crammed and mushed

and your life is in danger trouble and peril
i trample and stamp liars like they were campfires
so im bringin my nig proof for backup when i sing at my gig
in love with every rhyme that ive said over reels
with rhymes and its ultimatum just to cultivate em
thats why im spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen everybody walk out the back door
maybe thats what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
next time ill miss to let my fist hit the dry wall
youre still running through my mind when im knowing that you shouldnt be
me youre gonna be mine when im knowing that you couldnt be
im likin it but i just want the one that i was in love with
lets toast to the fact i moved out my mamas basement
i sit and drink wine and watch californication of life
how did i go from bein a man that you argued with
to meeting dwayne carter and putting alcohol an shit
you may see something else i used to protect myself
and send em back at you faster than they left the barrel

with a treacherous four cassette and a cassette recorder
and sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
dickhead is forced in til theres shredded foreskin
fetish for stickin metal forks in selfabsorption
better warn em what i lack in tact and a set of morals
and dressin george zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
with a bullseye on his back his whole chest and torso
or left on the doorsteps of trayvons dad as a present for him
appetite for destruction theres no suppressant for
aggressive forceful and less remorseful in every morsel
the rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
met a contortionist said when you wanna get sexual
she said however i fit in your schedule im flexible
at a traffic stop gettin harassed sign an autograph
he spat on it and brought it back lookin half in shock
and got slapped with a colin kaepernick practice sock
crack front axle walked in a bass pro shop with david hasselhoff pulled tabasco sauce out of my satchel
knocked over a fishermans tackle box and crash sound
you got it twisted all cause i offered this bitch
like spas in this bitch slob on it with gobs of lipstick
got a shoppin list for you to run some odds and ends with
its not a bitch on this earth i can be monogamous with
robin thicke with a throbbin dick on some suave and slick shit
but i shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin missile launches
screamed i hate blondes and became one im optimistic
shovin clark kents undergarments in the glove compartment
im double parkin up at targets trouble causer a double crosser
on stage dancin to brain damage whats the problem
nothings wrong the name brand is back to reclaim status
snuck up on em in ray bans in a gray van with a spray tan
ej in the waistband at the vmas with the stagehand
cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin
a fuckin loose cannon whos blunt with his hand on the button
second thing thatll make me happys walkin up to uncle sam
but as fate would have it i walked up in major magics
i snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
and send dylan roof through the windshield of the benz
like a windmiller with a thin build while his skins peelin
the instiller of fear not even a scintilla of doubt
the rock hudson of rock cause who would have thought
this much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of vivica fox with a box cutter
that was for 50 little slap on the wrist be warned
my squabbles im grappling with your time traveling with me
try and follow as i wobble relapse into history with a flask of the whiskey
thats the plan of attack when im fixing my problems
wish my chest wasnt having to get these rhymes off em
but the fact that i have so many rappers against me mind boggles
and why i havent come back on these faggots who diss me is
more of a spectacular mystery than a fucking agatha christie crime novel
swear i been contemplatin rubbing shit in your face til i smear it in
but then i think of molly qerim and i steer em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
im entranced by your looks come and give the shady franchise a push
psychopath bet you well get it poppin like a flat
got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half
are things that come to mind as soon as i start spitting rhymes like that
and these bars wouldnt dial it back if i star 69ed the track
in the slaughterhouse cause ya styles been butchered
my brains on hyperdrive someone put the brakes on
heres a smidget admitted to get your digits bridget
and hind sight should never left when i was living
and probably wouldnt be getting pressed by all these women
and then again i wouldnt rap the ones i was diggin
so annihilate the looking and talking alot about the hood kimn kimn
uh so selena williams just like my dad talks about more john dickn
this girl talkin how she pregrent she crazy so later i crushed that hoe and left baby
and never trust her no shit even she specialize in massaging on my testicles
and i never trust her a whole lot even on the first date she basically get her mouth rimmed
and turn around and ask me for a kiss no bitch im straight
and i never really get concerned how my own dick tastes
ye ye i think im about to slip on my swag juice
hell catch it in his teeth what is he hes a wizard
now baby dont forget to bring your lipstick with ya
who wreck it in a second tell me what the heck is sicker
wait a minute i just dropped my necklace in the liquor
now baby just to make a little breakfast and its six o
clock in the morning less you want to get some dessert
starts off with something like shadys an insane maniac
now all you needs an image to go with the name baby
its a long shot but is it possible theres a lane maybe
if not hes gonna have to come and change the whole game aint he
joe schmoe made it he took his plain jane lady and his baby hailie out the trailer
but he aint trailing anymore hes ahead of the race
people are feeling ya mic skills but these haters are ice grillin ya
willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
the way that it turned out was nothin like the picture that i painted in my head
sometimes a dream to make it its more fun than it is to actually make it
cause i slip in another world proceed take another hit
sniff til i fuckin hurl tell em all to fuckin sit
and spin til they fuckin twirl middle finger up again
no longer poor but lost your soul they call this fame
hard headed and hot headed bull headed and pig headed
you fuckers are not ready cause i got jelly like beyonces pot belly
they sendin armies out to bomb me constantly armed
picturin pistols spittin hollow points til they drill me
my criminal thoughts preoccupied with keepin steel

im trapped in the storm and fuck the world til im gone bitches be warned
im spittin at punk bitches and hustlin to be free
watch me set it niggaz dont want it you can get it
fuck with me have a hundred motherfuckers at yo do with fo
why should i be secluded i got a brand new horn to be tooted
to sum it up in a nutshell eminem will you kick it for me
a place where i dwell in  for some wonderful productions
is there a reason for this the hatred is aggravating
how many times will it take you before you realize youre fading
theres so much more to learn it pages left to be read
so put up the front while you jam for the grammar thats poor
while i hold the scrapbook thats heavier than the hammer of the mighty thor
therefore its never to fall into the hands of the wrong one  yeah its another
there are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side
but i see no borderline from under this colorblind
and some will probably never hold peices of the sacred
but then im finally about to put an end to the hatred
oh foolish pride what the hell is you tryin to do
you cannot beat someone thats better than you so quit trying to
so how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
youre graceless bland youre tasteless and youre faceless and
youre dull its time you faced this here taste this
straight from off of the pile one of the numerous styles
the date of my birth on the earth the deliverence of a starchild
to infridge on the boundaries so now the defiance is clear
to form an alliance is something even the giants fear
refuser abusin its accepted now its a trend  yeah its another
you know i dont understand why we all just cant get along
and every other white man when you that were your enemy
on the floor lies a broken door cause im not to be spoken for
stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
i try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
switch to the opposite now see it being reenacted
that spots already occupied and i dont play leapfrog
cause i do not wish to fight over territory thats already mine
but im always having to proove myself time after time
oh how i never understand how a man could be outcast
and bluffing with nothing to say stutterin and slurrin
and mutterin words with no meaning attack me side im like danny kdanny kane
and eat it like cheese pass me the crackers please
im possessed by evil demons that torture me while im sleeping
i keep dreaming of death and im hearing people screaming
the devils spirits trapped inside me and i want it out
im on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
with both of my wrists slit im lifted up in the air
and suspended in animation like someones holding me there
i feel somebodys cold hands wrapping around my neck
while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death
but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
doors open and close by themselves books fly off shelves
my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
two cups of holy water and im looking at em half full
but as soon as i go to touch em they turn into red rum
i heard em yell welcome to the norman bates motel
i ring the bell for service and i was greeted by his mother
covered in dry blood head still dented from the shovel
i said i need a room so i could try to get some rest
she gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
and told me thats just for starters satanll be in to see me later
try to turn me down bitch get fucked with a volume knob fuck all you snobs
2 bottles of lubriderm and a box of condoms is that all you brought
fuck that id rather turn this club to a bar room brawl
like a leech stuck in a vacuum yall aint nothing but a whole lot of suckin goin on in rap
crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygen
hitchcock better shit bitch ass got a zip locked in a bag
you fags aint been able to fade me since kid rock had a high top
keep blogging while im mind boggling my zone like im in the twilight

i catch a fly in that bitch you think you fly you just food
i give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude

confused as usual and you can get ripped she can open a can too
i came to cock block like a square fucking male chicken
yeah its shady slut the rest can suck on a big one
cos im as despicable as daffy duck when im spitting
mind full of demons i dont wanna hear them anymore
cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
so they start smoking weed well never get our day
before we learn to fly some bodies elses child caught in guns
go on and get your refund motherfucker i aint dead im the diamond in the dirt
i aint been crowned when i rhyme something special happen every time
i walk the block with the bundles ive been knocked on the humble
swing the ox when i rumble show your ass what my gun do
turn your back on me get clapped and lose your legs
till i bust a clip in your face pussy this beef aint over
if it wasnt for rain joy wouldnt feel so good if it wasnt for pain
lets pretend marshall mathers never picked up a pen
pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin they could blow away with the wind
marshall youre never gonna make it makes no sense to play the game there aint no way that youll win
pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
and it wasnt time to move and schools werent changing again
he wasnt socially awkward and just strange as a kid
he had a father and his mother wasnt crazy as shit
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
fuck a talent show in a gymnasium bitch you wont amount to shit quit daydreaming kid
you need to get your cranium checked you thinking like an alien and just aint realistic
now pretend they aint just make him angry with this shit
and there was no one he could even aim when hes pissed it
and his alarm went off to wake him but he didnt make it to the rap olympics
hes gon have a hard time explaining to hailie and lainie these food stamps and this wic shit
cause he never risked shit he hoped and he wished it but it didnt fall in his lap so he aint even here
doody most of my life its just been me and you there
i never gotta say i love you as much as i wanted to but i do
oh i went and dropped some presents off easter to them
two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
and dawg youll never believe this but sharonda actually talks to me now
jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
man how could you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
they say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
if its true how the fuck am i supposed to get over you
i dont know where it came from but it just stuck with us
til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
and this may sound a little strange but imma tell it
and hang it up in the hallway so i can always look at it
it feels like our general just fucking died in our lap
and i know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is there all still here and you aint
and doody its true you bought people together who never
but you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
to sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting
they tried to hit us for 5 years for that no question
and if i see him again ima punch him in the fucking face
and thats on hallie jade whitney lane and alainas name
i let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air
for you and pour some liquor out for you with obie in the parking lot of 54
i can hear them calling calling calling calling calling
its too complex girl you assuming cupids looming
i stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
cause you better put a fork in it if you think im a lay here just spooning yo
oh you think you the shit cause i just said you was beautiful
diabolical till the last molecule down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
rotten to the core to the bunghole all the way down to my soul from my head to my toe
ever since i was thirteen i learned how to sew so shut my own booty hole
cause i aint took no shit since i looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
i told these stupid hoes when i come back im a set this bitch on fire
and this time i dont mean im a pour gasoline on some chick and light her
cause this time when i fuck this world im put my whole goddamn dick inside her
pen got a mind of its own gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise

black girls are bitches thats why ima tell ya you better pull up your britches
i mean thats pretty sad when ya dating a black guy
and then you turn around and fuck another big black guy

aiyo this next song is dedicated to the memory of erik schrody
rest in peace we aint forget about you you fuckin homo
there once was a man who liked to jump around jump around
but he got too old to jump up and down up and down
so he put the mic down and picked the guitar up picked the guitar up
started singin the blues like theres no tomorrow no tomorrow
come on left his boys in the house of pain the house of pain
it was the wisest decision he ever made ever made
but the dumbest thing he could ever do could ever do
tell me now what you gonna do now what you gonna do
i remember how it was how it was when you were young
i remember back when you had the knack had the knack
and i remember when you had your first heart attack heart attack
i was right there laughin when i heard the news heard the news
i just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you woulda murdered you
maybe icets right you are a bitch you are a bitch
you come around when youre broke and you leave when youre rich leave when youre rich
but the dumbest thing that you could ever do you could ever do
remember back in 94 like right before ms everlast was whitey ford
when house of pain was out of fame like someone doused the flame
and they became destined to never jump around again
or even further back when i first had heard the knack
and you were down with syndicate i went to get your shit man
but then you went and took your style and switched the shit
now you sound ridiculous you dickless piece of shit
i liked you thought you was alright for a white dude
remember sway and tech when i came up and sat beside you
im sorry man i wasnt tryin to steal your light or nothin
but youre a homosexual white rappin irish muslim
then id be confused as you and i wouldnt know what to do
i never fucked with you why would you fuck with me
knowin i could rap circles around you what you nuts as me
plus i can sing better than you and i dont fuckin sing
and probably play guitar better and i aint never touched a string
but i aint mad at you id hate me too if i was you
and maybe thatll help me know what its like to sing the blues
you fuckin punk pussy you fuckin faggot sissy fuck
if youre gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin real gun
you wanna fuckin diss me diss me you fuckin faggot
you fuckin punk pussy you fuckin little bitch fuckin cunt
well to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
hes got the razor bablades and the chachachainsawsaw baby
you bbblundering bumbling mmmumbling dumm dumms
yeah here i come come you hear the rumbling vrum vrum
i guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
i hate to see her go but i love to watch her leave
but i keep her running back and forth like a soccer team
i like the way you walk and if youre walking my way
man if i could sing id keep singing this song to my daughter
now you probably get this picture from mu public persona
that im a pistol packing drug addict who bags on his mama
but i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
cause theres a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside my soul
and this load is like the weight of the world and i think my neck is breaking
should i just give up or live up to these excpetations
but i got a wife thats determined to make my life living hell
but i handle it ell given the circmustances im dealt
so many chances man its too bad coulda had someone else
but the years that ive wasted is nothing to the tears that ive tasted
so heres what im faceing 3 felonies 6 years of probation
ive went to jail for this woman ive been to bat for this woman
ive taken bats to peoples back bent over backwards for this woman
yea yea yea dr dre up in here yall know what this is
its what yall been waiting for funk master flex big kap
yo eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is baby
i used to be a lonely man only mad until i got a million dollars shit
now if i only had some fucking hair id pull it faster than a bullet
out of tupacs chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
im trying to grow it back again it was an accident
i had my back against the fan and chopped it off in amsterdam
i hate the straight jacket it aint latching and cant lock it
the cells padded and battered like someone else had it
before me and just kept throwing they fucking self at it
but this med is taking too long to bring me this sedadation come on
the first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
running up and down the street screaming fuck the police
when you still had your mothers fucking nipple stuck in your teeth fucking baby
now all they do is follow me around and holla bravo
hell yea i punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
im sick enough to fuck a man in his face but i wont
you faggots aint tough you just get drunk and become talkative wanna fight
walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
so when you see me on your block stumbling mumbling
so why on earth would i need drugs when i can fly on kites motherfucker slim shady
the whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
i set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron ahh
some people just dont get it but i wont let it upset me
they dont know what the fuck its like to be so fed up
and fed so many uppers youre down and wont get up
my minds got a mind of its own sometimes i cant find it at home
dont ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady
the neighborhood that i grew up in you could die for nothing
and dirty dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
ill have a fucking man raped with a bandaid over his mouth
quit fucking buying it im tired bitch im dying to quit
its like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
but now the white kids like it so they tell me i can buy it
but as soon as i get on the mic its like the night gets silent
either that or booed thats why i keep an attitude
and go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
im sick of being judged fuck it let me see a judge
ill confess to every murder i committed since 3 years old
i dont got no time to play around what is this what is this what is this
green lantern the infiltration we comin yeah
cause you say one more thing and it wont be nice
the other 50 percent of its whos color of skin it is
you better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
im just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
youd think nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
but i get a woody when these pussies try to push me
thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
with midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle
when i was just joe shmo rapping in joe blows basement
and lets move on if i aint shown that ive grown
you industry mutts keep walking around sniffing each others butts
what would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses
woady on my daughter i told you i love this culture
dont let em insult ya ima tell you one more gain
to get rid of some frustration or should i say shon
is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism
who only owns half of a magazine and the only way to have it seen
papa cant stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the  down
that i get him every issue when the thang comes out
disguised as problack theres no slack for a hartford college grad
in a fitted hat and a hunch back standing by the clearance coat rack
and you would destroy anyone that would try to harm her
and everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
what happens when you become the main source of the pain
i dont know go play hailie baby your daddys busy
know what you doing where you at or can i see you later
knowing they just want me cause im in the top spot
this is the first time dealin with this kind of fight

look who walked in the doorcome in its britney spears
gun clappinand all i need is one napkin to wipe the cum off
whatever the hell that meantbut i can still speak wit a accent
bonjuorim here with the cureoh yea lets rock it for the drawer
and the trumpets someones tryna summon someone i know somethins coming
but im runnin from it to be standing at the summit
and plummet how come it wasnt what i thought it was
cause here i sit in lucifers den by the dutch oven
even if it means im sellin my soul just to be the undisputed again
cracks in it bet you morons didnt think id be back did ya
how bout that im somehow now back to the underdog
but no matter how loud that i bark this sport is somethin i never bowout at
i complain about the game i shout and i pout its a lovehate
but i found out that i can move a mountain of doubt
even when you bitches are countin me out and i appear to be down for the count
is drivin around town with my fuckin whereabouts in a doubt
cause i been lost tryna think of what i did to get here but im not a quitter
im tryna be headstrong but it feels like i slept on my neck wrong
cause youre moving onto the next but is the respect gone
dont give me that sob story liar dont preach to the choir
you aint never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
nobody ever handed me shit in life not even a flyer
i think i see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me
but itd actually have to be a fuckin blowout to get me to retire
i know shit has changed in this age fuck a twitter page
if i stay passionate maybe i can stage a miraculous
here i go again center stage and i feel like im in a cage
its no wonder why i laugh at em cause why cant we win em all
it just goes ta show that when my backs against the wall
and im under a tack again that ill act as if im posed ta
with this pent up rage cause all these plaques in my office
are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin back again
so you son of a bitches dont duck youre gonna get riddick bowed
criticsll end up in critical think your shit is dope all youre gonna get is smoked
and im not stopping til im on top again all alone and on a throne
like a token of respect or a homage poem or an ode ive been owed
tossed in the air by my own arm and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
stop for no one i dont know but ive been told an obstacle that
blocks your road knock it over time to go for that pot of gold cause
you want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
plus im thinkin that theyre mistakin my kindness for weakness kill em with meanness
from gilberts to arenas call me gilbert arenas still appeal to the dreamers
i made it to the silverscreen but rockys still what the theme is
khalil on the beat cause makin the beat aint the same feelin to me as killin the beat is
stomach growl throbbin hunger outrhymin everyone
god just give me one shot i swear that i wont let you down
imma be around foreverandaday even in the ground
you cant sit still its like tryin to smoke crack
im the equivalent of what would happen if bush rapped
i got screws loose yeahhh the whole kittenkaboodle
im just brutal its no rumor im numero uno assume it
you need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dying
but now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it
its a different ball game you call names and you aint just rapping
we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happening
and asked him not to start it he wasnt going to go after him
until ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed him
fuck it 50 smash him mash him and let him have it
meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
but now hes fucked the game up cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication the same one that made me famous
now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing
almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart
we bout to get into a tail of gunner that details the dungeon
this is the pale moon illuminates the hail and thundering
god bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the earth
marshall double backed and got me from on top of the hearse
i realized that gods with us as soon as i decided to put that bottle down and pick up my tie bridges
the writings on the wall since niggas seen me at the baseball game with shady and jayz
do what you did to get it and dont stop dont stop
how can i be a quitter when haters dont stop dont stop
your body language is sayin your confidence is gone
you just gone sit there and take it or make em suck it
tell em where to shove it straight up you gon make love to the world or you gon fuck it
man what a catastrophy itd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy
did ya piss ass whoop me will be the day i say i aint poop
say im a sissy faggot record it play it back and put it on straight loop
grab the reigns on that bastard and came back on em
cause ill be screaming on these whores till im hoarse
i find excitement in wondering what ima write next
you might aswell cut the embryo out my momma and play catch with the baby
i have no desire stopping so why would i drop and roll
rappers are fun and im the time cause im just flying by em
man im laughing at em the entire time why am i up
cause tribulations i have triumphed bitch im fired up

im starving and it is kinda crazy how i keep eating
without taking a break and drinking a shake in between
breast that i barely take or some water to wash down
this awful taste i wonder if anyone out there can relate
the ones that dont know me dont know that im killing beats easy
this motherfucker man just wont shut up will you
but im only bein real when i say nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap
without throwin his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me
and you put jada on a track thats how much you suck
dick in the industry swear that you in the streets hustlin
you sit behind a fuckin desk at the source buttkissin
and you can even get the clearances cuz real lyricists
its not that we dont like you we hate you  period
what do i know about standin in front of a judge like a man
right in front of the only thing you have in this world  a little girl
i would never try to make her a star and eat off her
but what you know about hiphop shops rockin spots
when your the only white boy in that bitch just rippin
pressin up your own flyers and your stickers stickin

oh and for those thats dont know dont get it twisted yo the source has a white owner
by the time yall hear this weezy probably be home
let me tell yall niggers about one of the little tough guy dreams i had the other night
first i stop and then i drop and then cock another heater pop another litre from another clip
he thought he was a creature that could never never ever ever ever ever ever get his shit popped off get his block knocked off
when a nigger come and when a nigger front gotta give it to him good give a nigger what he wants
and if a nigger act up shoot him in the head in the face in the stomach in the foot or the heart
you dont want it homie you dont wanna start especially when mofucker see the gun fire spark
when i got the gun up in ya mouth ill make a nigger gun talk
imma hit him in the front homie hit him in the back
keep on hitting that nigger in the chest cavity till the motherfucker layng down flat
anytime i gotta defend a fool nigger it dont matter what it is homie i will
beat a nigger til you probably cant figure it out i identify the mofucker on the reel
word on everything a nigger really love it dont matter who it is homie i kill
but now im finally waking up out of the dream and i realise that life is so beautiful
and i aint gotta put my hand on a nigger unless its definitely necessary otherwise its unsuitable
ha going through a lot of different little things that make a nigger want to go and wanna get and wanna bring a couple goons out to handle a couple situations and let em elimination all the bullshit so i can sing
though we get a lot of love i love to get a lot of hate
though the ones who will try to hate will start to love cause its undeniable that everything i do is great even when i do it wrong imma share it in a song and im questioning the words in the end all along
i guess i gotta die first return reincarnated just to really see any other form
until that time imma sit and shine while i sit here with the grime give me credit when its mine fore i dent it with a 9 millimeter see the sign and the heater then im giving all my people get in line now
for the ones that hated tried to stop my growth from the light from a ball imma fight homie grudge its a kanye song see the way i make a mother fucker dont know love
but what you say just dont hurt me dont hurt me no more
thats right bitch and i dont need you dont want to see you
thats right and i dont need you dont want to see you
so you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
in the place all the way to the parking lot fellow
because it aint even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
bitch you get no love no no love no no love no
when i grab her by the hair and drag her across the sahara
with a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants
til it melts in his fucking palms and dissolves in his glands
yo i leave with no injure after i blow four in you
hope youre in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight
so suck my dick if you all dont wanna bump to this off the wall
hope youre in the mood to get rude and ill in a fight
so suck my dick if you dont wanna bump off the wall
yo you could buy jaz spittin hospital son admit it
aimed at the nose of them hoes its hard to breathe from
cause with my luck ill probably get shot by a stalker
probably got a fanatic waiting upstairs in the attic
he pull your mouth out til you cant finish a damn
til you gotta sip through a straw shoplifted a mall
i might as well as be a painting smashed on the floor
so suck my dick if you dont wanna bump to this off the wall
so suck my dick if yall dont wanna bump to this off the wall
im trying to shove the lava lamp up my fathers ass
id ask my mother but i think shes laughing at the plants
a half a gram of graham crackers and some van de kamps
i think ill eat some ambiens like theyre candied yams
shit i think i might have did it when i was dancing
while i was chopping one of my legs off and pulled a hamstring
hes always shoving something up his ass so why not that
and fck it while im venting lets shove a vending machine
up his rear end when hes bending over pretending that he
where should i put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair
put him under the stairs people are already under there
hmm i wonder where wait i think the cubpoards bare
stuff him up in the tupperware and shove him up in there
i bite into five and then i get high as a kite again
who am i kidding i couldnt quit this shit if my life depends
yeah rehabs nice i had my name up in lights again
you see thats why i cant decipher what life im in
i might pull a knife on your wife and slice her and dice her then
it sounds so enticing isnt it nice when im hype again
im nice when im like this no time to write just type it in
if i could get my pen to slow down whatd i write just then
man im about to hyperventilate i just have hypertension
i have the type of mental state you couldnt comprehend
unusually stupid of you for you to think im your friend
i said im goin on the front porch to get somethin
my lifes the worst thing that could ever happen to me
some of what i done fought through was the worst little sissy
there aint no situation that you ever had to respond to thats adverse
the messiest thing youve ever gone through was your purse
hang it up like a shelf gotta keep growin with it evolve
but youre gonna find that nothings gonna stick until you apply yourself
when youre down and theyre tryin to clown the fuck out of you
now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
ah screw it feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
punch through it just cock back put your all into it
now you gon take that rage and make that what you wage
if you stay strapped in your brain engaged in a steel cage match
show whos big and whos smallest youre christopher wallace
cant even cut off power to it but its what allowed
its a subject that i dont know how to shut up about
like a motherfucking tongue thats how i responded when i got shoved around
but when youre beyond belief you probably shouldnt wonder how
though what you sacrifice barely is half never give
but its like my shield at the same time i wield and my knife is will
sometimes i feel just like b real from cypress hill
can taste it its salivation im wagin retaliation
only thing youre capable of makin is a false statement
i write with the left same hand i hold the mic with
prevail at all costs be the only ones left standing
in the end but i aint gonna be the only one with the advantage
cause its cruel when you cause a bad heart conditionin
because this type of fag claims to never be gay i
im even liked better by your niece and nephew cmon
no respect in the hood fled to his neck of the woods
got in touch with his roots found the redneck in his blood
and said heck country western rap records are good
so he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
he cant rap or sing but he wants to do both haha
then kid rock and limp bizkit come from out of nowhere
its the start of an era rock raps harder this year
no ones tryin to hear some fuckin old fart in a chair
sittin on stage strummin acoustic guitar in your ear
so you start to get scared sit back and spark an idea
i punch you in your fuckin chest til your heart kicks in gear bitch
like ima say they names so they can be famous too
you just a quitter and you bitter cause i came along
and if you talk about my little girl in a song again
to the rap you wrote your fuckin answer backs a joke
the reason why you dissed me first and i answered you
you said i passed you in a lobby and i glanced at you
like i aint notice you bitch i had a show to do
like im supposed to be starstruck come over to you
you better shut your fuckin mouth while you ohfortwo

and hell be bussin tables in that bitch cleanin the toilets
aiyyo head thats why i fucked your mother you fat motherfucker
whitey ford forty and white lethargic ass dickhead

if you dont feel it then it must be too real to touch
goosebumps yeah imma make your hair sit up yeah sit up
imma tell you who i be imma make you hate me cause you aint me
all i needs a line but sometimes i dont always find the words to rhyme
to express how im really feeling at that time yes
this halfassed rhyme with this halfassed piece of paper
if i could just get the rest of this shit off my chest again
fuck im stumped oh wait here comes something nope
balls in my court but im scared to dribble it out
real enough to rile you up want me to flip it i can rip it
imma switch hitter bitch jimmy smith aint a quitter
imma sit here till i get enough of me to finally hit a fucking boiling point
put some oil in your joints flip the coin bitch come get destroyed
an mcs worst dream i make them tensed they hate me
by the looks of em you would swear that jaws was coming
by the screams of em you would swear im sawing someone
by the way they runnin you would swear the law was coming
momma jimmy keeps leaving on us he said hed be back
and imma come back and rub my shit in your face bitch
til youre sick of it you aint gonna have a choice
things aint always what they seem or cracked up to be
like all these fakin ass rappers in this industry

how you own three cars but you dont own ya own name
get ya business right boys the first class is in session
get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession
thats gon run ya bout a grand so start savin ya change
open a bank account quick and then follow these steps

whatever gets ya juices flowin could be speed or weed

sell it to ya whole hood out the trunk ya bastard
show all the nonbelievers what you destined to be
and in just a couple years you could be rich like me
she buy herself some clothes and she bought me back a chopper

and enough for one key i see seventy thousand dollas
dope game bitch let his mamma worry bout him you can holla at me for a fee
my name is kxng crooked i snap on you rappers often
when im spazzin im just gettin my passionate point across

now that i got your attention i feel i should really mention
dont come around here flossin big willies well willie lynch em
like every bar is a bullet when i pull it it sound like
bbbbb a couple of bullets are comin your way then it jam
then i pick up somethin quicker start killin everything in the vicinity
im a star goin to war with you clones like count dooku
like i walk in the booth rockin a biosuit made of plastic
and nasas galactic elastic travelin through space interstellar rapping
you die quicker than darren wilson walkin through ferguson
like simon cowell i cant let you ex factors survive
nah the times right and they finally limelightin the god of this rhyme writin
my mic can only be likened to poseidons trident and zeus lightin strike
and my metaphors are what thor was to the norse viking
im a born titan and atpoint kill em like swordfightin

i hope im rubbin you pussies wrong sort of like poor dykin
that means im higher than higher learnin look in my eyes
i am on my get rich or die tryin like when em was signin curtis
now we can do this a couple of different ways it really depends
or i could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims
i could tell you why im hot and disappear like mims
but the bars there put that on god ask an atheist
and if i aint the bomb at least im in the blast radius
im beating these kids indictment shit i like the terror
so its fuck metaphors and punches all the witty shit
cause the cancer left his lungs and its on my grandfathers heart
im supposed to put that to the side when the beat is on
im planning the funeral im getting the hearse ready
these niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready
these last couple of days ive been speaking to my peers
giving them cries for help i guess they need to see the tears
theyll shoot a suicidal rapper right here on the bridge
but fuck it gotta pardon em shout out to my squad and em
house gang shady im gone nigga my job is done
and pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars
and dream about that light that leads up to the lord
i have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard
for my lack of union between rap you and the rock and roll community
for unity between country music and mcs im claiming immunity
building this house exactly the way charlemagne the god and lord jamar thought it would be
building this house exactly the way i thought it should be
ive got floortoceiling windows and a cabinstyle mansion
bucks bears trucks boats tires spares fourwheelers
threewheelers twowheelers a drug dealer on call
plaques on the wall racks on the wall for my guns on the wall
lift kits low riders chop shops hi tops low tops cowboy boots
dixie flags american flags slumerican tags on my slumerican ass
ive got my name on the bathrobe and the flame on the back porch is lit
ive got two standup jetskis a top pedigree horse just to pet and feed of course
ive got bicycles for the kids tricycles for the babies
ive got new clothes old clothes vintage tremendous endless style
ive got flat screen tvs with skate videos on repeat
fefe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind
i got artwork from hard work yardworkers for yard work
ive got a paved driveway and photos in the hallway of me on my harley
see thats a quadruple entendre jay z eat your heart out
but these cyphers i treat em like a war dont want no mediators
nah this that grow up in the ps behavior next door to the greasy neighbors
people thank you i do this for all the mean creators
i was someone who never needed favors to get where im at
but to be honest i aint feelin like that man i just really like rap
with the shit that my pen state these rappers cant touch me
i was better than all you silly kids while trying to figure out who i really is
no rubber groove on my shoes had to fight so suspensions
did i say 3 in 1 thats funny cause theres 4 of us in the slaughter
thats a 3 and 1 i learned that in public school too
like whats in between a 3 and 1 and house gang i spoke to all 3 on 1 call
like i dropped 2 albums and 3 is 1 second from bein done
simple mathematics im addin up to all these rap addicts
dabnabbit i tried to quit but everything i kicks like the last dragon
i just gotta laugh cause yall pushin a lot of swag
im pushin this big ole hearse dont get body bagged
why i dont be hangin out where they be hangin out
if i dont got no business there i dont got no business there
when its on time its skull and bone signs at the stu
we got guns you only find on your cheat code screen
if you think i remind you of any of these niggas you wildin out
when theres drama i dont ask no questions i just clap in that direction
now imagine me hangin with yall and we rappin on the same song
or run through hell with a pair of gasoline hanes on
im a star but not on some i wanna be a star kinda shit
the only celebrity that give a fuck less than me is marshawn lynch
glock in the stash as a backup but the macll burst
cripple your style your first born childll come out
nigga ill show up to beyonces show posin as jay z
stagger in your studio session with a bomb strapped to my chest
jump in the 4 door mercedes with a 44 listenin to jojo and kci
drinkin and sniffin enough blow that it got me thinkin i can exchange sicknesses
banana clip in the air lookin like its bout to start singin its mac tonight
macs i use this mac as a component for thugs rollin up
i got this mac on and you better stay in that corner
cause shit can turn into that song except i dont give a fuck what day it is
slap this clip in this gat then call this arm christy mack
life of a giant but who needs size when youre wack and your teams soft
drag your girl down this hill til she admits that it feels like shes jackin the beanstalk
yours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before
mine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me
rolled up with the smith  wesson and drew on you like lets fight now
i do numbers i turn you and your crew into two plumbers
silencers so big it look like i got bobby shmurda tied to the front of the barrel
im already covered in sweat and i wasnt even ready to come in yet
off the top of the dome piece while i was sleep on the couch
i need my head banned like the guy who left cleveland ohio
scream fuck you on the way out and wink with a smile
this whole game can eat a dick im going back deep underground
but right now im back on that bullshit and you im singling out
cause youre so fucking outdated you should mingle a while
bunch of buster douglas motherfuckers is one hit wonders
knocked one out the park one catchy jingle and now
you think you fucking with me cause you sold like 300 thou
bitch i can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground
reach up swing from a cloud with 3 thousand people around
cause neither really wants to say what were thinking out loud
but i sure as fuck think i know how read body english no doubt
cause were trying to kill each other but lyrically
never spit that hustler shit it wasnt a fit for me
why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning
aint really been into diamonds since i put my first record out
became civil office swivel chair sterling silverware
screaming life is still unfair til i get a real career
the fuck am i gonna do until then this job is too fulfilling
two gajillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in
into some children at the food pavilion and buildabear
im pouring vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on em fore i go four wheeler riding
than i am with this retaliatorial rhyming for gloria steinem
i guess i mustve threw you for a loop like toucan sam
when i said i could use the sample cause yous a tramp
but fuck it superman wouldnt change in a phone booth for stan
in his pooper with lubricantwait thats too i cant
since honesty is the best policy ill give you the old college try
try to acknowledge my mistakes probably wont qualify
as a gentleman and a scholar but its time that i swallow pride
i think of all them times i compromised my bottom lines
and thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughters minds
but i may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke
never date an assailant who selfmedicates with inhalants
id meditate but i may need a better way to escape
heavyweights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains
but i still get the same respect as jay if i came on
stage in a fucking negligée everyday and liz claiborne
its evident that she aint never been with seven inches
bitch im a pimp so a limp dick is all youll ever get
ill bet you that i get the message sent who shes messing with
hella quick when i tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon
when i step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench
pedal to the metal im rippin this shit cause right away ill give it to a bitch like a pedestrian deadly as ever
you see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when i push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass
the last fifteen years and im predicting my next relapse
when i start shifting gears and shit resmears all over britney spears
we wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the super bowls
you dont know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though
been known to lose it though so if i overdo it you drove me to it
when i step in the vocal booth like im supposed to do
and i murder you on a fuckin track like tony stewart
you couldnt sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it
the day i dont say fuck you wall you can throw me through it
with the sentiments eminem isnt penning them for the women
im an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot
of the united states and the freedom i distribute these raps through
pickin up and deliberately whippin the statue of liberty at you wooooh
lalalalala i love my job whoo makes me feel like superman
food for thought  see how long it takes to digest
like a ghost in the dark theres a ray theres a light
but when planets collide theyll never see eye to eye
so children follow my lead and feel the vibe cause
you shouldnt take lyrics so serious it might be confusing
just trying to seperate the truth from entertainment
its stupid aint it i get sick of trying to explain it
see i could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
cause i came here to uplift let your woes be gone
constantly moving constantly using the constitution
but ima do this as a fuking hobby till then cause
and mimmick every move you make  slim you great
but wait cant you see im only here to entertain
cause man i see it feel it live it but its inhumane
for me to see you be influenced but pretend you aint
but they dont understand that ive been through pain
if you get to know me i could be a friend you gain
it hurts but youre jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
and its such a pleasure every button that i touch
i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust but

cause everywhere i go they love the bling bling flow
the ring on my fing cost jermaine a lot of dough oh

but you gotta search within you try and find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation not to give up
and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face

im the gap like banana republic and old navy and oooh
girl he had with him  ass coulda won the horse awards
now i could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
so i dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
you niggaz wear suits cause you cant dress no more
i aint play the hand i was dealt i changed my cards
i turned around and replied why yes but i prefer the term
brains power and muscle like dame puffy and russell
your boy back on his hustle you know what ive been up to
picked the truth beat for beanie and i was in the session with him
going back and forth just askin me to send him beats
and im thinking hes trying to get into managing producers
cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin with
and no id told him look man you wanna mess with kanye
you need to tell him that you like the way he rap yo you wanna sign him tell him you like how he rap
but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer ill sign you as a producer and a rapper
people were like this started talking about the ghost production
but thats how i got in the game if it wasnt for that i wouldnt be here
but shit just went poppin off like that i was stayin in chicago
i had my own apartment i be doin like just beats for local acts
just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy
get a pelle pelle off layaway get some jordans or something
or get a technomarine thats what we wore back then
i made this one beat where i sped up this hal melville sample
i played it for hip over the phone hes like oh yo that shit is crazy
jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called the dynasty
and at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me
so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic 2001 at that time
and really i just like picked the drums off xxplosive and put it like
with it sped up sampled and now its kind of like my whole style
when it started when he rapped on this cant be life
and that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album
i could say that was the the resurgence of this whole sound
you know i got to come in and track the beat and at the time
i was still with my other management i really wanted to roll with
hiphop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what im
sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did
for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he
gotta make a change try to move up to the next level and that day i
came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jayz and he said oh
uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time i got
to the studio you know how he do it one take and he said check this out tell me what you think of this right here
tell me what you think of this and i heard it and i was thinking
like man i really wanted more like of the simple type jayz i aint
want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the in my
personal opinion so he asked me what you think of it so what you thinkin
you know what im sayin man what ima tell him i was on the train
man you know so after that i went back home and man im im just
in chicago im trying to do my thing you know i got groups i got
acts im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like
poppin off the way it should have been one of my homeys that was one
of my artists he got signed but it was supposed to really go through
my production company but he ended up going straight with the
company so like im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad
news that dude was tryin to leave my company and i got evicted at
the same time so i went down and tracked the beats from him i took
that money came back packed all my shit up in a uhaul maybe about
ten days before i had to actually get out so i aint have to deal
with the landlord cause hes a jerk me and my mother drove to come on lets just go
i unpacked all my shit you know we went to ikea i bought a
bed i put the bed together myself i loaded up all my equipment and
and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up
there to baseline it was beans birthday matter of fact and i
played like seven beats and you know i could see hes in the zone
he already had the beats that he wanted i did nothing like already at
that time but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket
hat on i remember it like like it was yesterday and hiphop said
yo play that one beat for him and i played heart of the city and
really i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat to dmx no i think jay gon like this one right here
and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that
gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of
them faces like ooooooooooh two days later im in baseline and i seen
dame dame didnt know who i was and i was like yo whats up im kanye yo you that kid kanye
im like oh shit and all this time im starstruck man im
still thinking bout you know im picturing these niggaz on the show
the streets is watching im lookin these were superstars in my
eyes and they still are you know so jay came in and he spit all
these songs like in one day and in two days i gotta bring up one
thing you know come back to the story the day i did the cant be
life beat on track i remember lenny s he had some louis vuitton
sneakers on he think he fly and hiphop was there i think tata john
minnelli a bunch of people i didnt know all these people at the
time they was in the room and i said yo jay i could rap and i
spit this rap that said uh im killin yall niggaz on that lyrical
shit mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips and i saw his
eyes light up when i said that line but you know the west the rap
was like real wack and shit so thats all the response
he said man that was tite that that was cool that was hot
that was it you know i aint get no deal then hehe
so blueprint h to the izzo my first hit single and i just
took that proudly built relationships with people my relationship
with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my
career as a rapper because you know of course later he allowed me
to go on tour with him man i appre i love him for that and at
this time you know i didnt have a deal i had songs and i had
relationships with all these ars and they wanted beats from me so
theyd call me up id play them some beats gimme a beat that sound
like jayz you know they dick riders whatever so ill play them
these postblueprint beats or whatever and then ill play my shit ill
be like yo but i rap too hey i guess they was lookin at me crazy
cause you know cause i aint have a jersey on or whatever
everybody out there listen here i played them jesus walks and they
didnt sign me you know what happened it was some ars that fucked
with me though but then like the heads itd be somebody at the
company thatll say naw like dave lotti fucked with me my
nigga mel brought me to a bunch of labels jessica rivera man man you niggaz is stupid if yall dont sign kanye for real

then one day i just went ahead and played it i wanted to
play some songs cause you know cam was in the room young guru and

like the chorus went dont bite that chorus i might still use it so
i play that song for him and hes like oh shit oh shit its not even wack
i aint gonna front its kinda hot its actually kinda hot
like a rapper and im sure dame figured like man if he do a whole
album if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and
save the album you know so uh dame took me into the office and hes
like yo man we we on a brick we on a brick you dont wanna catch a brick
you gotta be under an umbrella youll get rained on
i told hiphop and hiphop was all oh word actually even with

already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3h that you
know cause i told him i was gonna do it and im a man of my word i
was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do then you know im
not gonna name no names but people told me oh hes just a producer
rapper and told 3h that told the heads of the capitol and right

sessions i started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes
man i was ready to go and they had mel call me they said
yo capitol pulled on the deal yo capitol pulled out on the deal
and you know i told them that rocafella was interested
and i dont know if they thought that was just something i was saying
to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever i went up i
called g i said man you think we could still get that deal with rocafella

i been pourin out some liquor for the fact that my pals gone
and tryin to help his momma with the fact that her child gone

cause they got me thinkin money mighta gone to the feds
so i aint goin to the dread but hell go on up to bed
and when i came the next mornin he was gone with my bread
and with that bein said i had gone on my instincts
and gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
and rented gone with the wind cause ida gone about 10
but i had gone with my friend and we had gone to the bar
and heard a nigga talkin shit so i had gone to the car

cause people is looking at me like im sniffing coke
kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while im got it
kid armani suits fresh fruits bally boots and benzes
live as a red jag a louis bag grabbing a blunt fuck it
kites off the jails buying sweats running up in stetson
the older head bolder head would train a soldier head
make sure he right in the field not a soldier dead
learn from others like your brothers rae and kanye
im living in the 21st century doin something mean to it
the system broken the schools closed the prisons open
we aint got nothing to lose motherfucker we rollin
with some light skinned girls and some kelly rowlands
so goodnight cruel world ill see you in the mornin
my furs is mongolian my ice brought the goalies in
got treasures in my mind but couldnt open up my own vault
my childlike creativity purity and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
reality is catching up with me taking my inner child im fighting for custody
with these responsibilities that they entrust in me
as i look down at my diamond encrusted piece thinking
well thats a pretty bad way to start a conversation
at the end of the day goddamn it im killin this shit
if you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
her mother brother grandmother hate me in that order

a half a mill in twenties is like a bill where im from
everything i dream muthafuckers im watching it take shape
while to you im just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
still move a bird like im in bed with mother goose
claiming they was with me when they know they really wasnt
i keep the citys best never said she was the brightest
so if you had it too it dont affect me in the slightest
i never met a bitch that didnt need a little guidance
so i dismiss her past until she dissappoint your highness

some wear a suit and tie they dont wanna remain average
some wear a suit and tie like a chain in a straight jacket
coppers harrass us the da attack us want us in chains like ba baracus
and a major factor in my decision to be a rapper was rebellion
being antiestablishment was attractive to a black kid from brooklyn
yeah sometimes our rhymes is on a frequency that only purists hear
a couple rappers try to beef with me nobody scared
question do it gotta make sense if it make dollars
its like sadomasochistic addicted to whips and chains
figuratively quite literally clinically insane spit flames when i vist the higher planes
try in vain to ignore dont buy the chain if you cant afford it
uh that old ball and chain had me chained up for weeks
of course im off the chain as soon as i hit the streets
thats what he did when she told him he should play this over
cause imma eat your food for that chain that i worn
cause you be running round like the chain makes the man
so it obvious that he dont know the chain of command
but it came with a check i remember on chaining day
it spoke for itself and this is what the chain would say
them chain snatchers are hoping that you aint ready
or therell be a chain reactionsince my chains heavy

lets make a move on these herds go somewhere private
im talking just me and you and a plane and a pilot
and ima let you know what you about to witness aight

a lot of rappers in my city they aint saying nothin
and these labels dont give advances so you get no pay
so these nosy niggas wont know that i get checks all day

nowadays you sayin that i should go jermaine i should go pharrell
either or my nigga make sure you dont get shelled

so you could get checks cut like benedict in oceans twelve

memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my chopped voice speech slow
sitting pretty in the game in the city that i claim

the dealers have customers they provide with the crack
my friends they dont even sit in the class when they should
not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good good good
lately i dont know about the friends that i hang with
im nervous round my boys it depends on their anguish
robbing rb singers specially if they know where the keys at
get the info leave with ya money man thats how the world is
specially when these youngns get turned down for work opportunities
how can we be so aware of these problems and not advance
at least start put a bid in its hard just to fit in
a lot of people only play they part when they spittin
they using this darkness for penetration in the hood
i took the ivory way in and yes im glad that keenan could
not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good good good
in this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
cuz she aint give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me
its like im using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
now im out of both and ive been thinkin of aleshia lately
cuz nowadays most of the thrill of chillin is gone and uh
and following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
and she dont know that you there when you standin right beside her
i bet that they knew it cuz in my mind i play through it
with and they lewis and a couple things that they true in
and in the end i listen but i dont see me as they do
cuz its my opinion my life my potentials for my wife
cuz nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh
and nowadays some girls are the type of person that
will tell they friends that they use him which is confusin
but golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for days
you take a dominique or another freak in the sheets
and you picture that she just slept with me for nothing
cuz it aint take her 3 of that shopping to get her next to me
collectively i look for a proper chick thatll rep for me
instead of seeing something she wants and callin and textin me
nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh
hittin clubs and skippin out on the class you takin
and the club district is poppin like literally every week
and start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock
fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
if this the type of chick you wanna be when you older i say
and im one of em the other four you know who you are
and then things come together on the spot like a couple thats eager
go ahead i couldnt give two damns like a couple of beavers
you can find him with black jays and socks like im andreena mill
and then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
the hustles i have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh
she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
crib was 2 mil plus i just bought a couch for ten grand
dont know if she feeling me or she be feelin what i buy her
so she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
chillin on the linen she all up in the closet so much
nice guys finish last so im winnin every race that i enter and she a
i bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
and frustratrated cuz shes already been addressed in they head
be a teacher open up shop if you can do nails fine
apply for a business loan and ill bet you that theyll sign
look this aint a song dissing half of these rappers
and a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
you just take in effect he got a stack with a mink on
now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
look you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
but you aint thandie newton and this aint crash here
respect yourself dont be convinced that these tricks will
my cousin who cant speak know the lyrics to tip drill
and i aint trying ta generalize every video girl you na mean
say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta
accept the fact that theres times that you gotta better yourself
you know as a person man i love to see my black women strong single
independent doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers
video you na mean its a wonderful thing baby so uh dont hate me for
this one ladies just take my advice you na mean cuz its like uh
she always showing up at these places she get invited
a lot of people dont realize how cold it gets during the winter
i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
now its december im driving and shes like wheres my hi
i swear that i never called you cause i really get shy
is what happens after the seaon where the leaves just scatter
where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
and some places is breezy and some it start snowing
and if you planning family vacations you better know when
but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
where cancun college students pouring water on their titties
yeah man its a funny thing going through the winter up here man
a lot of girls yknow wanna get close you might think they the one
forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach
she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet
she doesnt answer opens the door and just gets in the seat
she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat
shes bold but i roll with it im impressed cause shes sweet
then she says i heard your song and im obsessed with the beat
i mean the lyrics are good but im obsessed with the beat
theres a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat
i get her number she tells me to call her after this session
and so i do and its kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch
and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho
and now im proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench
she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench
but my boy say im actin different because i lay downtown
and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
tell everyone im the prince up in this cold clear town
instead of wondering if this is really gon last me the whole year round
but then spring shows up and its dallas in this bitch
the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
when we were together it seeming like way back when
ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa
instead of saving for marriage she saving for carrabanna
and its a shame she had me convinced that she couldve been a dime
gimme a second to gather my toughts strolling in the park ho
and watching winter turn to spriing such a beautiful day man
yeah man you know we had to switch it on em right
strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
im still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss
man but i got something to else to tell ya baby
i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up
with dress codes and light skinned girls that wont act right
and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin
we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
but this summer is different its a two man operation
got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
instead of dressup i walk in sweat pants and chomp clinkin
cause its a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside
that song special i recorded with voyce well its like a classified
yet i cant seem to find a heavy girl that possesses it
only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
and you get mad at the though of it giving ass to others
yet you find peace with yourself now least theres some room to ride
theres also room for improvement as soon as june arrive
baby just promise me if you go that youll come back
look i ought to be thankful because for women i have plenty of love
its long gone like brothers having a tape in their car
now they tell you to do whatever you want because its safe to explore
forget wait till its right now wait till its more
wait till he get gets a deal girl wait till the tour
to the point that drake compare me to anthony mackie
i tell them im not one for commitment and romancing exactly
and guessing her name i hope this shit is destined to change
its like i meet the perfect girl and she put me through some various shit
all i know is that i can never find the love that tyler perry depict
im guessing maybe shemar moore isnt really all pure
i gotta feeling this feeling inside is something its like and cant be all sure
because really what is a window without a car door
i dont want my daughter making a song like teairra mari did
go head girl and do that dance uh uh uh uh uh uh
but its all eyes on me like im coppin some vows for the bar
specialy when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
see broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
some body get the waiter they need a second plate a
this knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later
my money then lovers seperate for i commit the date up
and im tryin to find a chick i can meet who aint about the dough
when you ask why im hustlin in the streets thats just who i be
yo i live for the dough for the flow for feelin free
aint too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
because the ladies choose to love me they love me for what i do
im gon tell the people that we locking this down
i never dreamed that you would be so good to me and i know
i cant believe that its just really you and me and i know
i cant contain myself all this love loving me
girl ive been thinking about the way that you love me every day
because im in and out of town thats just how i gots to get down
yeah yeah let me get a little gospel on them yeah uh
this is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
and the way that i jack son you figure drake knew sam l samuel jackson
i cant explain myself all this love loving me
even when the sun dont shine i know youre my sunshine
i need to feel you next to me you want to feel me next to you
i cant contain myself all this love loving me
my nigga lil lee the only one thats really grippin
why you deck me up actin like like we cool if you dont feel him nigga
these rappers that feel a certain way but they get me yappin off
mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
he gave it to us for a cheap cost for prices we all could eat off
the type of nigga that yall niggas be studying learning how to get street off
shock em like blanca from street fighter heat got a
i said it and meant it the scorpios mind has many dimensions
ill say it in intent sentence indent on instant pimpin
the scorpios mind is not a game to play wit all day
since they dont show me sincerity i load up lock up
take shots at em i guess you could call it a parody
they onefourth from watermelon to a quarter felon dude you a pear to me
if thats not how it is it aint how it appear to be
you got blind heaters in my sweats is a mind reader
seein your physical the things that you never say to me visible
especially when one of your artist feelin threatened
cause im harnessin a weapon wont you pardon my reflection
mirror mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
to play around to perfection im the spittin image
my verbal camp is vivid i told you im spittin image
it seems we often want to start but never get to finish
my verbal campus is villanova and those of you feelin hova
so you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
which means if shit goes bad i say i expected this
and me and julien we never got the chance to communicate
and were gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
so why dont you walk up in the spot using less strut
and lets be honest by now you should be your own scholar
you still a protege thats the reason i dont holler
you stay ahead of the game im ahead of the practice boi
ima half to tell them about i been through on this know what i mean
very few give you that truth its either they cant do it with lyrics
or cant do it in spirit they cancel what they doing
the samples that they using cant get through the clearing
ill handle it since they just cant get you to hear it
my fathers early careering forced my parents to split up
my mother was a teacher my father was kind of fed up
with just being a florist the choir sang his chorus
and he got back into doing what he was doing before us
because money is an issue your son he gon miss you
and plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too
now you looking for exes you aint never expect this
you end up doing time and me i end up with a stepsis
nobody passing judgment or question where the drugs went
you know i hold you down because without you id be a wasnt
see her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
this is my life and so the rest is kinda been cool question what i been through
i write a verse addressing it and yes i might offend you
me being the closest thing to black and guess what rap music what i was into
rest of the kids were sheltered i never liked to fight
but when someone called me a nigger id punch them i couldnt help it
its parents that got these black and filipino nannies raising they kids
i make you happy plus im jewish he dont approve i think he want you to marry white
because black is black honey even if hes very light
always brutally honest and so i pin it to they faces
make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo
make a little money find a bunny to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo
am i hot as the rest should i strive for my spot as the best
like girls with double ds i gotta lot on my chest
theres questions that need to be answered thats not on the test
instead of staring at quizzes  now its models with breasts
i sit at home and say i should of been a pediatrician
im all alone at home with my mom and grandma and aint nobody running with me
so if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady daughter and her grandson
if not you gon make me call the burbs out in richmond
that have you niggas laying out on the curb they some hitmen
around the world and back and i dont wanna question half the places nick been
trying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder yeah
young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older oh
and you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers yeah man
to make my wife cuz bo bo bo bo this that gritty shit boy
im just trying to live my life cuz got me winded over here man
sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough
when they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
that there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
symbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
when your ideas so frequently get rejected people just get neglected
phone calls is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethics
you never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
i mean theres always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
that you couldnt help and maybe next time you aint in town
and the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spitting is fresher
concerned that people who copy whats in the past and turn the profit with cash
i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience
sometimes i wish that i would just chilled on the sneakers
in a house that i promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time
instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner im working hard on the winner
you say as long as im staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
because she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on tv
but shorty didnt quit there was something in the air
started in the morning wouldnt stop til after dark
and so he kick push kick push kick push kick push coast
i done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
the time it took me to get cool was a massive delay
trying to become a pro but keep showing up apprentice
mama probably would have done anything to prevent this
cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive
so every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse
and plus shed always give me speeches on the first
if i m staying in her house then i need to get some work
she say you need to be doing something other than skating
why dont you go kick it with your uncle in the basement
i ma let him know that your coming honey hes waiting
chekka playa playing chess looking through old school wrek a airs
now i coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here
lifes ever given me a plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
yes im literly landel lewis with a kick and a snare
the kids sick till them jeans put a rip in the pair
breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul
and it wasnt like they wasnt getting chased no more
just the freedom was better than breathing they said
until the cops came and said theres no skating here
they like damn whos drake wheres wheelchairjimmy at
i fooled yall aint shxt for me to come back from
id like to take this opportunity to formally welcome you to this
extravaganza that i call comeback season hope you enjoy your stay
how the fuck jay and dame gon break up before they meet drake
im sure it can be resolved im just hopin that they make up
im known in the city but need to bust out like a model to show chest
and babygirl if you dont like me its probably due to the fact that you are last like next selection
cause you are nothing like it and im  you  this
you cant come on this ride you need to earn height
and after that i take em back like returned flights
this the present and im a show you wut gifted is mayne
i was doin you know wuteva us rappers do to develop a new flow
these silly billies really feel to act as if they know drake
they know to hold they tongue and i spare em humiliation
its like ery fuckin summer i just switch it on they ass
and what you plannin for this summer i did it prior
this is the south and i am present when it matters most
the startins hot but pay attention to my latter flows
yeah i remember me and me and d used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
like what its gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
i didnt know much then but probably tell you a lil somethin now
that its hard to find a woman when you talented and black
cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
see theres everybody else then theres one top loner
watch blue and green diamonds i call it the earth face
im gettin ya cake i tell you how ya dessert taste
ive been urkel for some years its better bein jaleel
though i rock lean snap its better bein this real
its better drivin a car with the letter b in the wheel
to be the one and only nigga that you aint gon see
it aint even started im really tryna prepare yall
with or without a label man im committed to poppin
imma meet a lot of women imma do a lot of shoppin
same rappers thats all in ya face sayin drake is wack
imma do it cause i know i put you through it i know i put you through it baby
and i just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
ive drawn it and drew it til the pen was out of fluid
id like to introduce you to the first lady of the atf uhh
and we was trippin off of the speed at which life progressed
from meetin trey in atlanta to doin a cameo in his video
yeah one more time fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
sing it to em dreena lights bout to go down curtains bout to close but
i want yall to enjoy yourself on the way out yeah man
ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement
i was born up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
if you lookin for the goods then we got in the trap like
i done come all way from the days inn and all the hotels that stayed in
i took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now i say its sittin at amazing
but i cant blame females females cant really ignore something this obvious
i know you find it impressing whenever you introduced to me
you get who you want it wherever you be residing at
cause my time is limited and i aint trying to waste it all on you
ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl
yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
so its obvious yall gon steady be rollin wit some jokers unh
i am making stocks work while you working stock room unh
and i was praying i would drop june but label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
they tryna be the one that i done left out the show with
probably cause he know im exactly what you wish hed be
cause i done snatched the chips ahoy out his cookie jar
he just mad cause his girl at the house with her tongue sticking out like a michael jordan rookie card
i guess he thought he couldve been gotti in the flicks
but at this point im just poking her body with a stick
seems like she dont really need no gas for the trip
millionaire shades fade with waves i smirk at a nigga if he still rockin braids
that just lets me know that we aint on the same page and that goes out to every nigga except trey
they asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
mister bet you thats expensive cause its not a fugayze
and you can probably find him walking out of a macys
forget a girl they just thinking how to replace me
well i think that i should leave out on this note nigga keep your two cents
coming in the club with that fresh shit on with something crazy in my arm arm
but now all she wanna do is shop for christian dior clothes
he understands tha fact that im spending off shore dough
and please no receipts the feds like to explore those
i been doin this for years homie thoroughly ive thought it
through what it do i am currently recorded on a track admitting most of my currencys imported
repeat offender anita baker playin in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
we spend money so dont try to compete if youre in no position
my foot is just solely meant for this shoe it fits in
used to record in a basement that rennie grew was piffin
because i wanna win games coach im through assistin
and im a keep killin em until the day that drakes over
they bullshittin but i am equipped with great plumbing
thinkin what i coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
aside from talkin bout the d im throwin in ya wife
and i pretend tomorrow is the day im going in for life like that
there aint a pair of louis shoes i aint purchased
and i was on some shit but they served they purpose
liquor thats over ice and denim thats over priced
and tryna make all my goals for the future come over night
im tryna get that house in toronto with pine floors
and i try to put some lotion all over your contours
you cant seal up the bottle once all of the dimes poured
im tryna show you life through the tint on these tom fords
ethiopian girl ethiopian girl with yo long curly hair and yo big ass bootay
being cool aint enough homie im a freeze time like that
this shit is like an addiction conflicting with what i do
cause every weekend im rollin out stuntin in somethin new
just wait til i get my money right and i am going to ball
deceiving was cool ill never record the track again
even though my ex is fuckin one of my rapper friends
i dont wanna seem like i am always attacking them verbally
previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
steppin out the house tryna figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
i am talkin all day shoppin sprees in the mall with
where you cant wear hats inside its only slacks and ties
you just hold it down for your boy til the plaques arrive
and girl i used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
it aint a women in the world that can doubt that oh
i need a women not a girl cause im bout that oh no no
somethin like a wizard when i give ya what i give ya
but you know and i know that nobody gon do ya like me
and so she want this chef stick like napoleon dynamite
you feel it all under ya ribs like some tummy crunches
they dont wanna cut it they wanna wrap it and cuddle with
so whenever she thinks im serious im playin around
im writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like
my feelings never did go past some late night smash
i already know what you about cause i been the other man
im not tryna take it any further with you cmon
cause when im in she out and when she in im gone cmon
but regained it while she was buildin her house a home
it just proves that she dont know what to do wit her life
cause if so she wouldnt have to change her strategy
one minute she mad at me next minute its all good
and i caint try to justify that foul shit we do uh
i think to myself damn if only her nigga knew what yeah
i know what they thinkin they they hear the beat they aleady scared
the last breath of christopher wallace on that faithful night
the microphone brings life and death in the blink of an eye
hand blistering from many years of holdin the torch
when the skin rebuilds it grows tougher than leather
even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove
thats why im steady getting more money more cream
my flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
the attitude coursing through the veins of my city is a ice storm
i just take it you offended cause im taking advantage mayne
goin down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
goin down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
i have the dream but dawg me and success are two things you dont wanna find yo ass between
say whatever i never been concerned about who hears
im tellin you dawg always got the spring collection in fall
and with me women be bulidin these skeptical walls
but once youve slept with one dime man youve slept with em all
my necklace suffer from depression its forever blue
im sayin stop actin like teen girls are my only market
and its cool if you spill something its only carpet
torontos where you livin today then you aint makin records that people are driven to play
i would advise you to really make a move sooner than later
cause these are only the joints that im givin away you feel me
ears neck and wrists lookin like the kings ransom
and that thing in the driveway came with the spoiler
funny thing is you just notice me now but i was here along
this for anybody thats searchin for cash and purchasing fast
my pain you can experience through the rhyming boy
usually we understand theres a problem we dont talk to vice
and i could pick you up from work when you get off the night
drop you at the house soon as you get off the pike man
all i need is sum weight my scale sum money for bail
and somethin heavy on my waist man im easy to please
of somethin fast and im good man im easy to please
or maybe its that tron cause i sure do have a buzz
cause this shit isnt kosher and this shit isnt christian
its that muthafuckin heat you can find up in kitchen
wait let me slow it down down im gettin ahead head
plus its gettin hot so im a take a seat instead stead
im lucky i aint dead dead im on a rollercoaster ride yall
every record that ive done the station here done played it
this the city that i run this the shit that i created
they tellin me im the one and i havent even made it
maybe im hearin thangs cause im feelin like im faded
im feelin like im faded faded ffaded ffaded faded ffaded ffaded faded ffaded ffaded
and i aint gonna neva let a nigga hold me under dog
but yall dont really know me like you think you know me
thinking we gon hit your friend if you object to date
claim were early and be showing up extra late love
but yall dont really know me like you think you know me
for that ive been approached to sign to rocafella twice
and we laugh soon as you come and tell me like im ellen brice
well when they are all unhappy then it gets a little sticky
thats why i am little nicky to these devils in rap
nah they probably think ill break your heart girl
and if you give me the ass quick ill probably write about it
when you see i got a bed bring your ass here and lie down
will lead to me you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
at least i got status because i couldve been a local emcee
so im a take this hat off and im a hit it till i backs off
you the reason im thinking im getting sick of rapping
you probably think i walk around with my gun tucked and
but if you feel like putting all your notions aside
me cause i aint dumb shit im well rearedred like sunburn
and after me youll never leave no stone unturned uh cmon
though you appear as materialistic just like the others
and i dont see what you saying so they coming off paper thin
do more than just look you up and down to see if i could read you
not just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me
i wouldve gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way
you only out for the paperback thats written all over your face
until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under
me and you so crucial baby and that champagne so fuchsia baby
and if you let us girl im a bring the dresser along
instead of holding out wondering what it couldve been
i cant stop missing you wish i was still with you
all the things you liked to do when it was lights out
thats my only feeling inside when ever i get a song done

houstatlantavegas houstatlantavegas houstatlantavegas houstatlantavegas
and she dance to this song and she dance to this song and it goes
she doesnt ever worry if she wants it shell get it on her own
she knows theres more to life and shes scared of ending up alone
we all got dreams and we all star reaching all star peaking allstar weekend
one hotel room and all yall sleeping housekeeping knock to see if all yall decent
young girls envy the life yall leading never satisfied with a nice calm evening
you go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
carry you inside get you some water and undress you
i give you my all and the next morning youll forget
and she live in a mindset that i could never move to
until you find yourself its impossible to lose you
the game needs change and im the motherfucking cashier
but i left somethin in the car so i caught her in the driveway
and brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
and even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in
so trying to keep up with my progress is like a dead end
and right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show
back when i was trying to put a ring on alicia hand
and my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man
im everywhere these other niggas never been before
but inside im treading waters steady trying to swim ashore
im on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store
while this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy
ive always treated my city like some shoulder pads
so ill be right there when you wake up in the morning
wish i had the courage to say everything i planned to
my girlfriend my girlfriend call herself my girlfriend
tell me that we posed to be together til the world end
i sent ya girl a message said ill see you when i can
cause pussys only pussy and i get it when i need it
its been a moment since ive done some public speaking
and if i die im a do it reppin i never do a second
i done became bigger swerving right in my peers lane
one touch i could make the drapes and the sheers change
cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
how to get these label heads to offer em good figures
and me doing them shows gettin everyone nervous cause
them hipsters gonna have to get alone with them hood niggas
its all good im going off like lights when the shows over
my swagger just screaming motherfucker do you hear her
like everybody passing through the studio is in character
and i dont have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go
and you still make it even when they say your flight close
i cant live and hold the camera someone got to tape this
i make hits and like a bitch thats married i aint miss
watch hovs show embarrassed to pull my camera out
but i dont want to feel the need to wear disguises around
so she wonders where my mind is accounts in the minus
and yet i role around the fucking city like ya highness
cause i just see my ex girl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that im fucking right now
ive always been something that these labels cant buy
especially if they trying to take a piece of my soul
and thats what happen when you spitting what inside you
and they think they can market you however they decide to
cause to have known me would mean that theres a new me
and if you think i changed in the slightest could have fooled me
im just not the social type and campus life is crazy
problem with these other niggaz they aint never real
but your on my mind my mind my mind my mind my mind

leader of the new school its proven and its known
im sittin in a chair but in the future its a throne
i know you like to worry itll be better if you dont cause
pologize to you know to put yall in this position and vent to yall but
40 mom always say dont ask permisson just ask forgiveness
uh and life is so insane look what ive became tryna make a name
because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
they love it when you smile unaware that its a strain
its a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
i just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
its a weight thats on my chest whoever spottin me is playin
cause my dad called and got me feelin guilty and ashamed
and he payin for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
cause in memphis tennessee theres only so much to attain
so im fillin out the form at the counter once again
he say he love me i just hope he doesnt say that shit in vain
call me heartbreak drake im the hardest one to tame
with my own set of problems that be sittin on my brain
what they viewing as braggin is the way that i maintain
the shit i write while staring out the window of a plane
i swear im puttin on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin on like man
and i hate hearing stories bout who youve been with
racing against myself but im a couple steps behind
did you spend the night in his bed on the very 1st date
im still myself suicide bars i kill myself charge it to the game i bill myself
i got your dream girl riding in your dream car yeah
a yo drizzy you shoulda said dat on da hook you shoulda been like
its weezy f baby come to take a shit and urine on the toilet bowl bitches pussy ass niggas
the feds trying to clip us but we aint even trippin
i give you the business so button up your shirt straight
and i dont sit still i keep it moving like a driveby
i just tell the truth and so im cool in every hood spot
cover me im going in to buck you when the hook drops
if i said im going in then i motherfucking meant it
an if i brought in the club then imma motherfucking spend it
cost a few hundred bands an im motherfucking in it
no need for a room cause you know im fucking in it
she acting like she not but she know she fucking wit it
she said she seen it all i said no you fucking didnt
she said i cant feel my legs im like bitch me neither
i hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still
these verses are a chance to remembered and reprised
and i would be performing just as long as im alive
and if my tears hold value then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us
i stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
its just me forty o and neek standing in a huddle
who get questioned about they profit from this 40 million dollar scheme
just know that im in debt for you defending all our dreams
i hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems
you know i spend money because spending time is hopeless
i should be on top of the world here just chilling here
who find you before anybody ever has the chance and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game
and realize when your there sometimes the shit dont feel the same
people think ive changed just because my appeal has grown
and now security follow me everywhere so i never actually am alone i just always feel alone
i was wishing for some things and now am used to those
even though am living out what you would call the dream
and him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
money just changed everything i wonder how life without it would go
from the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
truth over fame you know i respect the blatant shit
when i hear them talking i just dont know what to make of it
doesnt come natural bear with me it could take a bit
and you can see im pacing it so that im always chasing it
wayne put me right here thats who i get the paper with
i hope that my success never alters our relationship
look at how im placing all my napkins and my cutlery
i could tell it wasnt love i just thought you fuck with me
who couldve predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
and you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
you couldve been the one but it wasnt that serious
their was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it
that felt good all and all i learned a lesson from it though
its been years though i just learn to deal with it
for real me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
and now shes sayin shes more lonely than ever before
searching for that feeling tell me where is the magic
yeah but i guess i gotta find it first thats why im really going off
isnt it ironic that the girl i wanna marry is a wedding planner
that tells me my life is too much and then moves to atlanta
i just thought youd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know
im always up too late i worry bout you there alone
cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
i tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
dont be fooled by the money im still just young and unlucky
yesterday when we were getting high you were invited
i said that we could kiss the past goodbye but you werent excited theres no way to fight it
im living inside a moment not taking pictures to save it
i mean how could i forget my memories never faded
i cant relate to these haters my enemies never made it
and thats how she met my pops and now my garden is enourmous
i avoided the coke game and went with sprite instead
uh huh thats word to the millions that they putting up
what am i afraid of this is suppose to be what dreams are made of
but people i dont have the time to hang with always look at me and say the same shitthey say
uh am i wrong for making light of my situation clap on
now that im on i dont really want to worry about getting back on
im just trying to stay on get my fucking buffet on
i heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
and i be acting like i dont know how to work a phone
but hit redial you see that i just called some chick i met at the mall
the one that im laying next to just looked over and read it
man i couldnt tell you where the fuck my head is im holding on by a thread its
like im high right now the guy right now and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now
cause we just having the time of our lives right now
well all right uh i live by some advices girl lisa told me
the other day lisa told that she missed the old me
maybe cause the girl i thought i trusted was who set the whole shit up
or the fact i havent seen em since they locked big rich up
im bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
cause half the time i got it right i probably guessed
i know way too many people here right now that i didnt know last year
i swear it feels like the last few nights weve been everywhere and back
i shouldnt have drove tell me how im getting home
i can teach you how to speak my language rosetta stone
i swear this life is like the sweetest thing ive ever known
all i need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
i did it over night it couldnt happen any quicker
but point the biggest skeptic out ill make them a believer
it wouldnt be the first time ive done it throwing hundreds
when i should be throwing ones bitch i run it ahh
and i swear i got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me i know better than that its just game
but ill probably still be the man when everything is over
so im riding through the city with my high beams on
tellin everybody that i know we about to be on on on on
i aint tryin look like i lie to these niggas that i came up with
thats my team never would i let a woman come between
this our dream wu tang clan niggas want that cream
if you cant hold your liquor you better quit right now
how bout you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed
make the most out of tonight and worry bout it all tomorrow
tell me can we kick it like ali shaheed and phife dawg
feels like when you gettin to that paper hip hop hates ya
kush rolled glass full i prefer the better things
niggas with no money act like money isnt everything
im having a good time they just trying to ruin it
shout out to the fact that im the youngest nigga doing it
she aint trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind
i i i tried to told you drizzy still aint nothing nice
bracelet saying you should quit cars saying fuck ya life
i got money in these jeans so they fit me kinda snug
plus the game is in my pocket nigga this is what i does
all up in your face man i hate to put you through it
cause i dont really know who imma lose this year oooh
i got that kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
bought the president the louis presidential briefcase
we got the hawks i aint talking about the peach state
man for petes sake scratch that sweepstakes hahahaha
i mean we can even rock them shoes if it dont got a comma on the price tag you know
i mean i mean but then again who whowho looks at the price tag you know
you say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
you just do it for yourself youre the fucking coldest
but they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
from all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
they get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career
guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
unless you play these suckers just like bob play the guitar
now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
i say im buying you declining i think thats kinda bizarre
ya dont need it greedy or easy as these other breezies
who fuck for bottles of riesling or bowls of baked ziti
wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
they tell me time is money well well spend it together
mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
and jason had this girl tammy with a purple bentley
i just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
and enough money to loan us a little something extra
if it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it
that if you were a star youd be the one im searching for
but i just always feel like theyre in need of something you got
heard that youre a student working weekends in the city
trying to take you out girl hope youre not too busy
put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
no youre not imagining theyre looking at you long stares
even though shes standing out she looks like she belongs here
and your cousin fine but she dont have my heart beating in double time
ever since you came around its obvious you shut it down
so take that fuckin dress off i swear you wont forget me
youll be happy that you let me lay you down down down
i havent slept in days and me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways so im single
but i aint santa i got something for these bad bitches too
i mean paparazzi on me trying not to get caught out
they always seem to catch me with the women that i brought out
baby dont hold on too long cause thats how them stories start out
and all those girls that played me eat your muthafuckin heart out its drizzy
and since you cant escape me do i ever cross your mind
because all this shit is new to me im learning to behave
and still spending every dollar they encourage me to save but im good
and no matter where im headed i promise to stay the same
im just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
ask your girl im the realest nigga she been around
when i pull up in something new and park it by the haters
its hard but its fair i told that girl life hurts
the names young baby you know i live that thug life
she saying shit in them streets so whats the deal
like for yall to meet the love of my life her names the game
just know she right here on my hip my beautiful wife
unforgettable youll never forget this ya understand me
dirty and clean i could use a glass of cold spades
they always tell me nobodys working as hard as you
and even though i laugh it off man its probably true
im just here making all the music that they party to
before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
this shit feel like when fredro starr was at sunset park
they must be talking to themselves hoes hands free
and i just say i wrote it for your girlfriends kelsey grammar
yeah thats what life becomes when youre doing you
welcome to hollywood dont let this town ruin you
and if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin you
just know that she gon tell another nigga when she through wit you
hey guru tell hom to go to open that ace right there
a trillionwatt light bulb when im in the nightclub
caught the mayweather fight cause the satellite was crispy
the smart moneys on hov fuck what the dummies talk
cause you fuckin around with me and my dogs is farfetched
thats why none of these dumbdumb could dun him off
you let em tell it they swear that they invented you
but i wouldve went insane had i remained the same me
drizzy back up in this thing im ready whats happening
im bout my paper like a motherfucking scratch and win
nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
i will have a model wife your bitch is as hot as ice
every time you see me i look like i hit the lotto twice
i love myself cause i swear their life is just not as fun
someone tell maliah im on fire she should work tonight
call up king of diamonds and tell china itd be worth the flight
ill be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height
she just tryna make it so she right here getting naked
but i could never love her cause to her im just a rapper
thats why me and lil jazz bout to spaz can you keep up
and drake just stand for do right and kill everything
i hope one day we get married just to say we fucking did it
and girl im fucking serious im with it if you with it
cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
like i catch em stealing flows cause i swear i never loaned it
and life aint a rehearsal the cameras always rollin
so come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin
i just hope that you miss me a little when im gone
i just hope that you miss me a little when im gone gone
man i swear my bitches do it till they suck the brown off

cant be too  wide opentheres nothing i wont do
saying i just want what i cant have ohoh ohoh
i bet if i give all my love then nothings gonna tear us apart
i bet if i give all my love then nothings gonna tear us apart
lately ive been drinking like theres a message in a bottle
you could thank me now for all the info i give to you niggas
i guess a hit doesnt add up to a career for you niggas
whod thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
i could relate to kids going straight to the league
when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed
and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals
you make friends with mike but gotta ai him for your survival
at this point me is who im trying to save myself from
rappers hit me up and i never know what to tell them
cause they think that i can help them get back to where they fell from
except the niggas that i came with they good for life
uhh shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
i think im spending all my time with the wrong women
i think i have a chance at love but knowing me i miss it
that make me wish i had a little less mileage on me
but do i ever come up in discussion over double pump lattes
im probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
i got flows for the marilyn monroes whos there before it all
and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
i know there somewhere watching so im trying to make them proud
and tell me im the highest guess we finally get to see
they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it
im the black sheep but chris farley wears the crown
and i know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
im in the world where things are taken never given
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision
and im aware that this could be the last time you listen
i was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
with this girl named lorraine who says shes from la
and keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay
yeah i hear you talkin dont know who you tryin to flatter
you dont seem to understand that iiim ready for ya
uh red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind
flash black lingerie white diamonds what a contrast
and i could audition for this and i could be part of the cast
and i could produce for your future i could codirect your past
plus i got a sex pistol pointed right at you bang
proven over and over again thats why im hard to doubt
plus im young money till the death i took the carter route
im more than ready too hope of something that you thought about
you know you at the top when only heavens right above it
who else really tryin to fuck with hollywood cole im with marley g bro
and i wanna tell you somethin that you prolly should know
fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
thats why i pick and choose i dont get shit confused
live in the same buildin but we got different views
dont like my women single i like my chicks in twos
i hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole
plus i been sippin so this shit is movin kinda slow
just tell my girl to tell her friend that its time to go
if you aint runnin wit it run from it motherfucker
all right now somebody show some money in this bitch
and i got my bs with me like some honey in this bitch
yes im in the building you just on the list of guest names
i been fly so long i fell asleep on the fuckin plaaaane
im on the paper trail it aint no tellin where it took me
beautiful black woman i bet that bitch look better red
limpin off tour cause i made more off my second leg
damn where you stumbled at from where they make gumbo at
but you know me i get on this bitch and have a heart attack
hiphop im the heart of that nigga nothin short of that
somebody remind me where i am thats right im at home
im right where i belong girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
the smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
i know they aint getting money like we do so its on
i was looking for the one now im feeling dumb for thinking that it was you
i was wrong now im back up in this bitch going harder than i did watch me do it
probably why im back up in this bitch going harder than i did
take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
careful what you wish for you might just get it all
you cant have my heart the doctor told me id be dead without it
thats why im steady yelling weatherman weatherman
ive had a glass or too so somebody remind me where i am
tryna get the green like im waiting at a long light
broke just doesnt suit me girl and every night is prom night
so someone please tell me the problem with my competition
i ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
and me falling and landing in love shouldnt happen
because everythings easier to get into than get out off
because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
who just had his linen suit drycleaned bitches whats up witcha
i hate callin the women bitches but the bitches love it
and girls countin on me to be there like missin rubbers
im on some marvin gay shit a bunch of distant lovers
and fear that i wont remember i wish you could still accept me for me
the simplistic beauty that all of them southerners have
and i got them wedding ring flows that engagin shit
i really think you stare at yourself and you see things
and no im not sayin im the nicest i just live life like it
i never threw away that paper with my grammy speech
because i havent hit the pinnacles i plan to reach
kisses all on her body she tells me live in the moment
but you werent excited theres no way to fight it
they call me one thing but they treat me like another
im cheatin but do i love her well more than any other
so its personal to paint you this type of picture
when your wife is like your sister seems you barely ever miss her
but another dude kiss her you lose it you wanna diss her
wanna hit her like you hope no one do to your sister
they say its none of yo biz when them boys call their miss
and the halls shatterin cause life is like a battlefield
raw dog hope she go and get that mornin after pill
what type of life is this so many different choices
too many different opinions too many different voices
so i dont know if aaliyahs gettin a little brother
and thats too much trouble sorry i cant love you
uhh am i wrong for makin light of my situation clap on
now that im on i dont really wanna worry bout gettin back on
i heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursin home
and ill be actin like i dont know how to work a phone
some chick i met at the mall that i barely know at all
and plus this woman that i messed with unprotected
the one that im layin next to just looked over and read it
man i couldnt tell you where the fuck my head is im holdin on by a thread its
cause we just havin the time of our lives right now
the other day lisa told me that she miss the old me
maybe cause a girl i thought i trusted was who set the whole shit up
or the fact i havent seen em since they locked big rich up
im bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
aint no turnin back for me im in it til its over
that you had fun cause ima need a cab just to get me home
and even though we let it go its better that you know
now when it come to making money im a printing press
and when it come to making history im like  son
a million dollars stacked it sounds like a good beginning
we on the top now go back and tell the hook we winning

and i thought i found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
slave to the pussy but im just playing the field nigga
yeah are these people really discussing my career again
and i be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
but jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
i just been playing i aint even notice i was winning
man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
and fuck you to the niggas that think its their time
yeah its whatever you know feeling good living better
like this was my comeback season back back in the day
now youre trying to find somebody to replace what i gave to you
the way youve got your hair up did you forget thats me
and the voice in your speaker right now � thats me thats me
you and the music were the only things that i commit to
i never cheated for the record back when i was with you
but you believed in everything but me girl i dont get you
i really wish she had a different way of viewing things
i think the city that were from just kinda ruined things
its such a small place not much to do but talk and listen
the men are jealous and the women all in competition
and now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
i could tell that you been crying all night drinking all summer
praying for your happiness hope that you recover uh
started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
faded way too long im floating in and out of consciousness
i just take my time with all this shit i still believe in that
i had someone tell me i fell off ooh i needed that
and they wanna see me pick back up well whered i leave it at
i know i exaggerated things now i got it like that
tuck my napkin in my shirt cause im just mobbin like that
you know good and well that you dont want a problem like that

soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
and thats who you thinking is bout to come and make a killing
i guess it really is just me myself and all my millions

fake ids and the trash we going straight to the top
rooftop closed with a handful of girls and they all so foreign
why cause they loving the crew they loving the crew
took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall

for all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
i got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
the realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
ive never really been one for the preservation of money
nah i much rather spend it all while im breathing
that ovo and that xo is everything you believe in i know
whats a life with no fun please dont be so ashamed

the same day we say were in the area cruisin in toronto
hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me a false word
sat down with a few drinks located where you cant see us
and how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin
and it didnt help cuz it made me even more rude and impatient
so blame it on mr ovoxo the reason why im breathing on the vanity i know
the reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
so dig a shovel full of money full of power full of pussy full of fame
probably shouldnt be driving it just got so much harder
live a little cause niggas die a lot and lie a lot
the living proof that you aint gotta die to get to heaven
you girl you right there you look like you like this shit

thats whats important and what really happened before this
when me and my crew was all about this rapper from new orleans
i was pushing myself to get something that i deserve

wondering whats on your mind it must be hard to be that fine
everythings adding up youve been through hell and back
ill give it all away dont care what the people say
cant you tell by how theyre looking at you everywhere you go
wondering whats on your mind it must be hard to be that fine when all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
its your worst nightmare its my first night here
and this girl right here who knows what she knows
so im going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
and her purse right there i dont trust these hoes at all
to all these women that think like men with the same intentions
talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
even a couple pornstars that im ashamed to mention
and every time i run into these niggas they want no problems
buy them sixes and chains and some bracelets and rings
i never hear the disses they try and point out to me
im more concerned what niggas thinkin about christmas in august
and chef it like mrs fields theyre making the cookie stretch
stunt like im workin overnighters right by the motel
matchin rollies for real matchin rovers for real
places they say theyve been weve actually going for real
im really killin shit fuck all the jiggy rappin
to pull all your skeletons out the closet like halloween decorations
i know of all the things that i hear they be pokin fun at
i havent figured it out cause my story is far from finished
im hearing all of the jokes i know that they tryna push me
i know that showin emotion dont ever mean im a pussy
know that i dont make music for niggas who dont get pussy
so those are the ones i count on to diss me or overlook me
lord knows lord knows im heavy i got my weight up
roll this and boost your rate up its time that somebody paid up
a lot of niggas came up off of a style that i made up
but if all i hear is me then who should i be afraid of
everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal
i fell in love with the pen started fucking in ink
still allergic to broke prescription straight to the paper
and these niggas talkin like hoes they mad they not in my shoes
everyday them hammers bang whippin yay like anna mae
i run the game but the ladies think im running game
rosay and drake im gettin cake nothin short of great
you aint gotta run and tell nobody they already know
weve been living on a high theyve been talking on a low
are you me are you me what you know about the team
man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene
baby girl you need to stop it all that pride and self esteem
got you angry about this girl im with in all them magazines

in case you starting to wonder why my new shits sounding so htown
but when its all done baby im yours if youre still around
when a good thing goes bad its not the end of the world
its just the end of a world that you had with one girl
and shes the reason it happened but shes overreacting
and its all because she dont want things to change
so cry if you need to but i cant stay to watch you
cause youll say you love me and ill end up lying
we live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
cause were scared to see each other with somebody else
people around you should really have nothing to say
me im just proud of the fact that youve done it your way
if theyre the ones that tell you that you do the right thing
but i gotta say oh babe oh babe why is this so familiar
you mustve done this before this cant be your first time
we mustve been here before its still fresh on my mind
you got that shit that somebody would look for but wont find
you mustve done this before this cant be your first time
you got your guards up i do too theres things we might discover
cause you got a past and i do too were perfect for each other
cause to her im just a rapper and soon shell have met another
so if tonights an accident tomorrow well recover
and i know im not supposed to judge a book by its cover
i dont wanna be in the blind but sometimes i stevie wonder
about her and she with it if im with it and im with it
i know what makes her smile but i wont know what makes her different
or should i just be realistic lipstick on the glass
i know this aint your first but its better than your last
tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in atlanta
and thats when she text me and told me she prayed it
i learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
i learned hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
even though its fucked up girl im still fucking wit ya
get the fuck about my dressing room confusing me with questions
you getting money you think them niggas you with is wit you
get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like
you getting money you think them niggas you with is wit you
its like 09 in your basement and im in love with nebby
and i still love her but it fell through because i wasnt ready
and your back hurt and your neck hurt and you smoking heavy
and i sit next to you and i lecture you because those are deadly
and then you ash it and we argue about spending money on bullshit
and you tell me im just like my father my one button you push it
now its fuck you i hate you ill move out in a heartbeat
and i leave out and you call me you tell me that youre sorry
you love me and i love you and your heart hurts mine does too
and its just words and they cut deep but its our world its just us two
i see painkillers on the kitchen counter i hate to see it all hurt so bad
uh maybe i should walk up the street and try and get a job at the bank
cause leave it up to me j and neeks were probably end up robbing a bank
then wayne calls on my phone conversation wasnt that long
after all the things that we been through i got you
its like 06 in your backyard and im in love with jade
and im still in love cause when its that real its when it doesnt fade
and my father living in memphis now he cant come this way
over some minor charges and child support that just wasnt paid
that still dont explain the love that you have for me
i remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
i never really had no one like you man this all new shit
made the world i know bigger changed the way that i viewed it
told you i think im done acting im more in touch with the music
you said either way ill be a star i could go so far
but i could do anything you said that and you meant that
you took me places you spent that they said no we went back
and i thank you i dont where id really be without that
all those other men were practice they were practice
you working with some ass yeah you bad yeahuh uh uh
girl you working with some ass yeah you bad yeahuh uh uh
dont give them no more chances oh girl they had their turn
everything for a reason theres things you had to learn from them
let a real nigga make it right you deserve that much
let me put something in your life put something in your life
you telling me its only been a couple other people that youve been with
ima trust you ima give you the benefit of the doubt and ima love you
you can even call me daddy give you someone to look up to
i hate when people say they feel me man i hate that shit
you wont feel me til everybody say they love you but its not love
and your suit is oxblood and your girl fuckin hates you and your friends faded off shots of
what you ordered than forget about the game you on top of
your famous girlfriend ass gettin thicker than the plot does
and you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
and deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
and you do dinners at french laundry and napa valley
scallops and glasses of dolce that shit right up your alley
they put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
its feeling like you own every place you choosing to be at now
walking through airport security with your hat down
stead of gettin a pat down they just keep on saying that they feel ya nigga
you wont feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself youre in it
and tell the world around you that your paper work is finished
and steal your mothers debit cards so you maintain an image
and ride around in overpriced rental cars that aint tinted
you know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
the sun is up when you get home thats just a way of life
when you record with 2 others that want the same things
and so you up there every night you swear you getting close
you drop a couple songs and hopes that you can beat a nigga
and come out every night to let the city see the nigga
and even though they hate you they just keep on telling you they feel ya nigga
im driving right up to it now make sure you got your coat on
that runway can be cold especially after summers rolled on
and all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
performance out the years got you asking whats good at home
my young niggas poppin ms and sippin dirty jones
im bout to fuck and im just praying that it feels good
they say more money more problems my nigga dont believe it
i mean sure theres some bills and taxes im still evading
i come through them bitches still scorching as if i didnt notice
im out here messing over the lives of these niggas
she said kiss me like you miss me fuck me like you hate me
and when youre fucking someone else just fuck her like she aint me
damn those words are scary those words are scary virgin mary
i was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
its all for her to carry bags she deserve to carry
i hate that hoe i make it so hard just to talk dont i
ill end up stopping wont i and by the time i end up stopping
youll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga dont lie
shes losing it right now cause if i wasnt who i am she woulda been moving in by now
but instead were moving slow i guess shes used to it by now
and she gives me all her trust and im abusing it right now
but this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
you just told me i aint shit and i guess im proving it right now
i say id rather be with you but you are not around
half the time we dont end up fucking i dont ask her for nothing
leave me in the morning i dont see em for months
but i just hate sleeping alone i hate sleeping alone
full name and birthday i book a flight and you come to me
but she dont want a weekend she wants all of me or none of me
if she cant work with all of me then she say she done with me
you say that you over me you always end up under me
you know how it goes dont be crazy dont play dumb with me
dont start with yo shit i put you back in yo place
she tells me i bet you wont you wont say that to my face
and hang up yeah how dare you tell me its tougher for you

still getting brain from a thang aint shit changed
rest in peace mac dre imma do it for the bay okay

get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasnt meant for
heres a reason for niggas thats hatin without one
started from the bottom now we here nigga we made it
yeah tom ford tuscan leather smelling like a brick
rich enough that i dont have to tell em that im rich
self explanatory you just here to spread the story wassup
paperwork takin too long maybe they dont understand me
ill compromise if i have to i gotta stay with the family
not even talkin to nicki communication is breakin
i dropped the ball on some personal shit i need to embrace it
im honest i make mistakes id be the second to admit it
think thats why i need her in my life to check me when im trippin
tell me who dissin i got some things thatll hit the culprit
them strep throat flows them shits to stop all of the talkin
all of the talkin got one reply for all of your comments
fuck what you think im too busy thats why you leave a message
born a perfectionist guess that makes me a bit obsessive
that shit i heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
i piece letters together and get to talkin reckless
i dont change like credentials you know you see the necklace
im tired of hearin bout who you checkin for now
just give it time well see whos still around a decade from now
lately ive been feelin like guy pearce in memento
i just set the bar niggas fall under it like a limbo
the family all that matters im just out here with my kinfolk
off everything my pen wrote we went from bundy to winslow
this for shorty up on glengrove who love when i catch my tempo
the fresh prince just had dinner with tatiana no lie
the difference is that with mine they all come true in due time
i might come through without security to check if youre fine
you dont have to prove shit to no one except yourself
and if you end up needing some extra help then i can help
tryna get my karma up fuck the guilty and greedy shit
how this nigga workin like he got a fuckin twin though
and i wouldnt change a thing if you payed me now real nigga wassup
people i believed in they dont even show their face now
nothing really changed but still they look at me away now
bittersweet celebrations i know i cant change what happened
i made every woman feel like she was mine and no one elses
girl you know that i remember dont be a pretender
getting high at the condo thats when it all comes together
i got em worried like make sure you save a slice for me
i should have spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slipping

if you nervous hit the lights i know we only fucking out of spite
i could fuck you so good then i hit you with the 9am in dallas who you like
stadium packed just glad to see the city on the map
i just gave the city life it aint about who did it first
its about who did it right niggas looking like preach
i find peace knowing that its harder in the streets
i would only go there cause theres niggas that i know there
i just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
and you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
you aint ever worried cause hes not who he pretends to be
things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
and fucking with me mentally i think its meant to be
they dont really leave your ass with a mothafuckin choice
its yours its yours its yours its yours thats for sure
next time we fuck i dont wanna fuck i wanna make love
next time we talk i dont wanna just talk i wanna trust
next time i stand tall i want to be standing for you
and next time i spend i want it all to be for you oh oh
peaking im peaking wake up with me this weekend weekend no oh

cause the new drugs got the kids trippin these days trippin
couple bitches tryin to have me on the maury like nigga its yours
you should be supportin but where you been at on tour gettin money
you aint even hit me when that nigga had threats for me
girl you dont love me you just say that shit to get to me
when the last time you did something for the first time
by the time it gets to you shit switches these days
its yours its yours its yours its always gonna be yours
but your shit is like the police asking us questions
trying to fight to the finish just to see em all finish
im liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
bitch you better have my money when i come for the shit like odb
who else making rap albums doing numbers like its pop
drake you know aint nothings changed with these funny style niggas
i just ask for some blessings at my grandmothers grave
i swear i could beat serena when she playing with her left
this aint the son you raised who used to take the acura
hate to leave the city but ive got to do the overtime
i should let you know ahead im coming back on my worst behavior
hold up hold my phone they used to never want to hear us
cause i love me i love me enough for the both of us
thats why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of
i needed to hear that shit i hate when youre submissive
passive aggressive when were texting i feel the distance
i look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping
i like when money makes a difference but dont make you different
i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement
i want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation
and influence a generation thats lacking in patience
ive been dealing with my dad speaking a lack of patience
weve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted
when he put that bottle down girl that niggas amazing
we might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us
he said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
you a flower child beautiful child im in your zone
my mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
yall dont even know what you want from love anymore
i search for something im missing and disappear when im bored
who you settling for who better for you than the boy hah
thinkin about texas back when porsche used to work at treasures
or further back then that before i had the houston leverage
when i got summer a michael kors with my mommas debit
then she started telling me how ill never be as big as trey songz
boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off
when i could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it

guess since my text message didnt resonate ill just say it here
i hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment tellin herself
that shes too sick to get dressed up and go do shit like thats true shit

look fuck all that happy to be here shit that yall warned me on
im the big homie they still be tryna little bro me dog
like i should fall in line like i should alert niggas
when im bout to drop somethin crazy and not say im the greatest of my generation
like i should be way more nervous and less dismissive
and not talk my shit and do it major like the niggas who paved a way for us
and understand that im not doin it the same man im doin it better
like i should feel�i dont know�guilty for saying that
they should put a couple more mirrors in here so i can stare at myself
these are usually just some thoughts that would i share with myself
but i thought fuck its worth it to share it with someone else other than paris for once
i told her that she could live with me if she needs to
cause she supported since hot beats right before wayne came and got me out of the back room where i was rapping with jaz over beats that i shouldnt have in the hopes for the glory
he walked right past in the hallway three months later im his artist he probably wouldnt remember that story
but that shit stick with me always couldnt believe when he called me you never know it could happen to you
and i just spent four ferraris all on a brand new bugatti and did that shit cause its something to do
yeah i guess thats just who i became dog nothing was the same dog

the haters just bringing me and my people closer actually
what happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen
are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened
we just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two
supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you
my plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
and treat the money like secrets keep that shit to ourselves
6 god i think i was destined for this shit when i was round keyshia cole and ti

kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you

but you always had something to say every other time
everybody that i met on the way tries to get in the way
im fooding and serving them all like im working for minimum wage

someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
if i ever loved ya ill always love ya thats how i was raised
its gonna get a lot worse before it gets any better
i made a decision last night that i would die for it
just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
cant get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
you know 40 wants peace but im down to cut ties for it
if they dont have a story these days theyll make one
life is always on man i never get a break from it
doesnt matter where i go i can never get away from it
first place first place man we cant be tied for it
like mannie like stunna man shit is big time now
and i made a decision last night that i would die for it
i told em they belong to me that goes on for forever
and i think we just get closer when were not together
i know you heard that my pool parties like mardi gras
i know you heard that my girl is sponsored by audemars
thats why shes always correctin me when my time is off
these days i dont talk bout them days like i miss em
and you shouldnt miss em either we different people
i wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
we was still a secret couldnt come in through the front
girl i had your back when all you used to do was front
thats for sure though i made a career of reminiscin
time got a funny way of tickin things are so much different
act like you know it fuck them stories fuck the shade that they be throwin
understand i got responsibilities to people that i need
a lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow
you could never say i came up and forgot about your ass
i had to let go of us to show myself what i could do
and now youre trying to make me feel a way on purpose
my enemies want to be friends with my other enemies
so dont play with my money this summer im serious
weston road flows i did this shit for my nigga renny
back when we couldnt buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
feel like we go back a century runnin the store for centuries
then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
he let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
we probably wouldve got in less trouble just goin with him
feel like i never say much but man theres a lot to know
feel like the difference between us really startin to show
im lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
you number one and im eddie murphy we tradin places
lookin in the mirror im closer than i really appear
creepin like chilli without the tender love and care
i got a price on my head but theres a risk to collect it
i might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
feel like they wanted me dead but couldnt pull it together
40 the only one that know how i deal with the pressure
a couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
a lot of problems that cant be fixed with a conversation
your best day is my worst day i get green like earth day
you treat me like im born yesterday you forgot my birthday
you dont be scorin perfect you dont be workin like how we be workin
you platinum like rappers on hersheys boy that shit is worthless
you get the message over and over like it was urgent
and then act like you aint heard it when you see me in person
the only thing i did to end up here was put the work in
used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
nowadays they just shakin my hand to hide the tension
a lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
shout out to kd we relate we get the same attention
thats when i plan to retire man its already funded
how quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
leave it to niggas like you to show em light in the darkness
don julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
i get you all you can eat just have some patience with me
you wouldnt tell me you loved me started seein monique
last time i heard from monique tminus was makin beats
i used to hit the corner store to get to tahiti treat
the best ever dont ever question you know better
but shit aint always how it seems when its sewed together
yeah i let that last line breathe it take a second to get it
weston road flows my confidence level gettin settled
dont get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
dont let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
been flowin stupid since vince carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
drinkin hypnotic with glenn louis i been through it
first take drake you know i rarely have to take two it
big apple had the white hummer parked right in front of fluid
and we be walkin in that bitch like we already knew it

why would i say all these things to have you feelin a way
why would i tell you im 30 away if im not on the way
why do i settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces
why do i want an independent woman to feel like she needs me

and she took my word for it thats all i had to say
thoughts too deep to go work em out with a therapist
need yall to know that i never needed none of yall niggas
its like a front of the plane nigga its all business
look theyd rather run up on me than towards them goals
you dont worry bout fitting in when you custom made
now me and kobe doing shots the night before the game
numbers going unlisted just to create some distance
i might see you on and off but ill never switch ya
niggas quick to double cross like both of us christian
running through the 6 storming through the contracts
they think i had the silver spoon but theyll get it soon
i still got something left to prove since you left me room
and like its going in a trunk i put it all behind us
where you tryna go i got it ill take us wherever
they wanna pre the movements gotta start to make em sooner
id share more of my story but you wouldnt believe it
its far fetched like i threw that shit a hundred meters
wonder if youre bendin over backwards for someone else
wonder if youre rollin up a backwoods for someone else
doing things i taught you gettin nasty for someone else
just when shit look out of reach i reach back like one three
vibe switch like night and day i can see it like right away
i came up you changed up i caught that whole play

comeback season in the works and now im thinkin bigger

since my dad used to tell me he was comin to the house to get me
imagine how i feel to watch another nigga at the top
you know that if it wasnt you you would be dissin you dawg
i can see what youre talkin bout no way to soften it
too focused on peoples feedback and provin em wrong
they say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot its on
whoever wore em before just wasnt thinkin big enough
cause if i run in the game in these man the seams are splittin
no pun intended but theyre smellin defeat in the air
they tell him that hes talkin crazy but he doesnt care
majid jordan droppin ob droppin not to mention me droppin
feel like we paid the refs off man we fixed the game
if i havent passed you yet watch me catch up now forreal
most number ones ever how long did it really take me
the part i love most is they need me more than they hate me
so they never take shots i got everybody on safety
i could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
niggas make threats cant hear em over the laughter
i mean where you think she at when she aint with you
give these niggas the look the verse and even the hook
thats why every song sound like drake featuring drake
got us watchin our words like theres wire taps on the team
guess its funny how money can make change outta niggas
a couple albums dropped those are still on the shelf
i bet them shits would have popped if i was willin to help
i got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
thats why i aint got time for a nigga whos time is comin
a lot of niggas pr stuntin like thats the movement
but if i stay in the shit theres a bunch of corpses
stashin money like hoarders off multiplatinum recordings
anything happen to pop and i got you like uncle phil
weezy been on that edge you niggas just need to chill
if anything happen to papi might pop a nigga for real
comin live from the screwface livin out a suitcase
but im feelin good johnny got me pushin two plates
my weight up i refuse to wait up i started a new race
its funny when you think a nigga blew up after lupe
some niggas been here for a couple never been here again

diamonds hang around my neck the crib is all finished
no love for these bitches i said this year its all business

half a mill to perform i cant let them fuck that shit up
plus i love the way my middle name looks when its lit up
new verses crush the hood like im driving into something
drizzy drake the only one that got the gift without the curse
hard to make a song bout somethin other than the money

but i guess this is what i gotta do to make yall rap
i mean woah cant fool the city man they know whats up

its just that all of them women you slept on were working though
new niggas came around theyve been waking up with
she like why you even give a fuck you not even here
well out there there aint nothing for me and i think i need to come home
no wonder why i feel awkward at this fashion week shit
no wonder why i keep fucking up the double cheek kiss
along for that ignorant young money miami beach shit
a couple of artists got words for me thats never fun
they say its on when they see me that day dont ever come
when all is said and done more is always said than done
now im the guy that know strippers by they real names
rochelle jordanne thick bitches they just talked me out of 4 grand
how did a pile of kush become the mountain of truth
how did a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth
tell me it feel the same its all ive been dying to hear
lights get low and thats when i have my brightest ideas
i wish she stopped checking up on women i cant stand
i used to brag about it to my friends and now im feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
and maybe thats all they do is just pretend damn
and this will be the year that i wont even feel shit
they trip about the amount of people i brought along
but im just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
need credentials for everyone of these toronto kids
listen closely to my shit i swear it sounded like home
ive always wondered why you bothered putting make up on
i repeat cause i dont want no singer and i dont want no model i dont want no fashion designer or nothing
shawty whats the deal dont think just cause your simple that you lose your appeal
baby just because i wanna look good dont think i aint real
all the clothes and the doing of my hair face nails makes me feel good
what you been saying to me aint exactly what i need to feel and know
your the one im wearing for and where i will always go when i need a reason to
baby yuh mek mi happy wine up yuh sexy body fi papi
why am i the one you wanna get into it for the drama
i got a lot to say and thats the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now
so i could fall through like old times and hit it up
those nights when you need someone else call me over
couple of other things id rather do than talk about that right now
told you about giving him chances on chances on chances
hes not holding you down hes holding you back right now
i threw my hands in the air and said show me something
we talked about love and what life can really be for me
remember one night i went to erykah badu house she made tea for me
we talked about love and what life could really be for me
had to take you back because i know youre down to roll
if you can get it from me you can have it now you know
all your friends asking where you stand with the boy
you would probably lie bout it on the stand for your boy
thats why you i aint never got to worry bout the boy
you know you got that really good insurance on the boy
uhyea alright well alright well alright uhuh yeah feels good
lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado for the girl whos a student and her friend whos a model
finish the whole bottle and we gon do it big like thisyea and he was just practice
he aint in your world you can take him off your atlas
girl you on fire can i be the one you match with
ill give you the credit card and baby you can max this ahout
they say if you get her you can understand her better
and shes known to be a cheater but thats only if you let her
so when they talk and try to deter me its like whatever
tell em i appreciate the help but i just gotta know for myself
these girl groups with their overprotective managers got paparrazi over my shoulder
snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space
just take it easy on love and slow your heart rate
goodness gracious the top is such a hard place yeah
but if you never even been there it kinda makes sense why you dyin to pretend dear
spillin all your drinks and takin pictures in your swimwear
i know that shit is exhaustin girland your mistakes are costin girl
and maybe you dont need the help but i just gotta see for myself
sometimes i laugh with god about how you cant stop me
and shit i set aside to make sure my people are gettin by
brunch with some qatar royals and my cup is all oil
you know its real when your niggas will take the fall for you
and we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you you aint hard boiled
man that boy growin up quick that boy know he the shit
that boy singin on every song when he know he can spit
that boy manifested it that boy knew it was written
that boy know that they shittin on you and they cant get past you
you shouldve followed all my moves you wont realize til after
and if i left shit to chance i wouldve picked a name like chance the rapper
you know they love to pop all that shit when im not around
get us donuts and coffee well wait for him in the lobby
and i gotta tell him chill sprite got me on payroll
i think im on my eighth flow just watch me paint flow
we all do it for the art so i can never hate though
signin off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
dog what the fuck happen to so and so where did they go
they too worried bout bitches and fashion they go missin in action
on some hunger games shit i would die for my district
i mean forreal girl you know i had to do it for yah
so that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off
got guys on my back about schedule saying its too tough
i want women to cry and pour out their heart for me
and tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
we go on dates i send the maybach out the neighbourhoods they never seen it
and some charges how the fuck can i get her to paris
so chances are i get the border to issue me clearance
cant tell you how much i love when niggas think they got it
and i love the fact that line made em think about it
ymcmb these niggas make it so hard to be friendly when i know part of its envy
i take em off in the house because the throw carpets are fendi
and i feel like lately i went from top 5 to remaining 5
my favourite rappers either lost it or they aint alive
we stayed up christmas lights in the middle of summer
but you tell me do you wanna talk about talk about
you say you got a lot on your mind sit down lets talk about it talk about
really tell me what i gotta do to get you to talk about talk about
cause its been getting a little too long for you not to talk about
so tell me what you would like me to do to help you help me help you
to venues in manchester just swerving with balotelli
they even bring up these niggas make the comparison
still aint got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
running through the city with niggas id give a kidney
and peoples feelings have changed ever since i became somethin
this the shit thats on my mind i just keep it to myself
staring at my city lights through the plain window as i write this song
i dont just flow i over flow i be filling up the sink
like i left the water on i run this bitch if anybody ask
black paint chrome trim same color as the logo for the raiders

and my father did just pass to make my problems multiply
and i know nobodys perfect but you finally crossed the line
and i gave you everything but you was never satisfied
and you said i was the one just like you told another five
feel like its a competition against all these other guys
every time i see you feels like time is moving slow
its unfortunate for me i have some trouble letting go
even though its in the past i just felt like you should know
and you hate me when i get high but youre the reason that i smoke
and i gave you all my trust but you just tore it all apart
now youre all i think about while im layin in the dark
been a couple months and youre beggin for me back
and i love all the attention im not sure how i should act
and youre saying that you miss me i refuse to say it back
even though i still do want you i dont have the time for that
cause these women stay the same while this niggas chasin cash
and your problems are so small girl just trust me they aint bad
cause you cryin bout a nigga while im cryin bout my dad
and its eating me alive shouldve taken me instead
i want this shit forever mine ever mine ever mine

uh you can look me in my eyes and see i aint myself
and tell em all leave their cell phones on the table where we see em
niggas hatin i just wish they would say it when i see em all

looking for some things that i think i can find in you in you
its only me but im seeing four shadows in the light
i know i gotta pay something i know that days coming
because if i dont say it here then i wont say nothing
could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
too reserved like i called ahead for me and my lady
ever since the blue basement i found god and i lost patience
vaughan road academy star player�my minds not all there
used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
people too scared to tell the truth so its all dares
my dad used to use a soap bar till its thinning out
we all wide awake late at night thinking on what to change
back when the bar i set for myself was out of sight
fuck the rap game its all lies and its all filthy
2 percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
if i didnt live it but still they try to tell you im not the realest
like im some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
but really its you with all the drug dealer stories

i can tell cause i look most of you dead in your eyes
and youll be trying to sell that story for the rest of your lives
me i dont judge im just going off what the math is
they all look at me like what have you done for me lately
i like your older shit but wasnt in love with the latest
im down 200 in vegas but winning life on a daily basis
it seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces

their life is so shit so they invent any reason to beef
these 25p cheap mcs acting like wealthy celebrities
if you buy into any of these mans lifestyles  keep your receipts
flexing like an evil beast but really underneath hes a chief
i came from the school of lethtotheb i came from the school of d double e
if you dont like grime then youve got no taste like vegan cheese

i only want sexy girls around me tell all man dem go way
i am looking for a princess that will come back to my crib for a little but of roleplay
and when i kill these girls i dont tell nobody like oj
gonna rock this motherfucker up til this world is mine
sitting at home watching tv werent paying the bills
played a lot of every saturday and wednesday hoping that i win some mills
all i had was a black phone pool table and a few musical skills
trynna make money in a place where everybodys looking for deals
i was a little man with a mouth full of stones watching the olders play jenga
i only had dubs and everybody else had scream and benger
responsibility of the oldest child trynna feed each family member
so sitting at home making love to my princess werent on my agenda but i told her im out there trynna find some cells
i stoped showing her love so she got on the first train to london and went off the rails
started to party all the time in the west end eediot girls
it was only a matter of time before she had sex with somebody else
i got money in the bank now but when i came back it werent the same
telling me stories i dont wanna hear bout crazy nights and cocaine
you wouldve thought that she was getting money for everytime she said a exboyfriends name
but i guess thats the price i payed for a little piece and a big chain
i picked myself up now i got self made tatoo on my skin
im the kind of man that wont play the game if i aint gonna win
sometimes i feel like i threw the perfect relationship in the bin
but im a big man with facial hair and a beard so i take it on the chin
if i could turn back time and make it all right god knows i would
cause no matter how much i do now i feel like im not doing as much as i should
its like the meaning of life for a women is to make a badboy turn good
thats why theres so many old school gs under the thumb and single mums in the hood
ive seen karma part 1  2 now im just waiting for the sequel
crazy nightmares are one of my old cats trying to stab me with a needle
my dad phoned me last night and told me that moneys the root of all evil
i told him in this day and age moneys the only thing thats motivating people
its funny how i woke up early in the morning trynna chase the queen
i dont know why i keep lying to myself this slay will never be clean
i wanna talk to her about it but for now i just settle with a answer machine
50 word article on the back of the paper 1 2 mic check
come again i did a grime tune with diddy but nobody werent singing my praise
then i released a porno video they put me on the front page
so find me on the tallest building in the country singing as loud as i can
i feel so alive and i couldnt give a damn bout any person who aint part of the plan
when you looking for boy better know better look to the stars
you wouldve though that i wouldve stuck to the music
the truth is most man dont like me cause they girls keep calling me cute
now they call shorty a pornstar a negative feedback when i go i drop short notice
but at the same time if i listen to what you tell me i wouldnt be here
so me looking at youtube comments is counterproductive
another twitter account with no pic 10 followers following everybody hes dissing
what dya know about looking in the fridge and all you can see is a white light like heaven
when i was young i used to beg mum for some money to buy a birthday present
now me and p diddy on the ichat laughing and joking
remember its boy better know all year from october to september
we built this ourselves so the only man that can ever knock me down is skepta
i got bumble bees tryin to figure out how i got this buzz
all i want is a kiss and a hug but somebody told specsavers i still cant see no love
trust no ceiling no doors i walk all over the beat
and they say ive changed i say im making a change
so i keep on driving im upset but i keep on smiling
and when i get knocked down i get back on my two feet and i keep on fighting
i sacrifice all privacy so i can live my dream what a irony
cus now my reality is far from the place i would like to be
somebody remind me what happened last night cause i cant remember a thing
when i woke up i found a note that said sorry i had to go ily
man are like swear down youre a mad man skeppy i must have had one to many
cause i cant remember anything after the two yager misters and a bottle of henny
who you trying to diss who did you fight with who did you kiss who did you dance with
saw 2 men that i dont like but i already lit up the room when i walked in
no need for fireworks tonight unless its on the side of a bottle
and im only here for one night on the high so im trying to find me a model
had one drink two drink three drink four had one too many now youre laying on the floor
woke up somewhere youve never been too in your whole life
i get it popin mainstream still im the best in the scene
so i can understand why everybody wants to do it like me
then we see them on the camera walking talking tryna do it like me
they really really really think they do it like me
you think im a human being nah man im a freak of nature
put it up in the sky nice and high wave it side to side
you aint been to a show until you been to my show
they threw some dead punches but im still alive and kicking
theres too many cooks in the kitchen bitchin trynna do it like me
mcs dont wanna see me on the scene i take it old school like
nah rude boy what dya mean what dya mean what dya mean you fool
i was born on september the 19th dont care about february 14th
pay me for my 16th before i start acting like its friday the 13th
people here are starting to hear you as the king of grime because youre the one person that has stuck by this genre of music
im the im the guy that we love this music i love grime world
if there was a room you get me and a microphone and a pc lock me in there
im coming out with tunes oh yeah maybe years old
i just came from the bin and i know what the bin looks like
and im like mum how come you never told me that i had all these cousins
this corner im standing in never felt claustrophobic when i came in 10 minutes ago
and all my real friends know im a still keep it 10 multiplied by 10
i never knew that one song could make my whole life change
but i cant complain this is the moment ive been waiting for
picked myself off the floor and now i get a warm welcome when i walked in the door
the guy youre looking at right now is the guy i was this morning
even when i top the chart ill be the same guy that i was at the start
so she stands far but close enough for her pictures
so i sit here watching a dvd logo bounce around the tv
now that im getting that paper i heard a couple man want me dead
so i went out bought a gucci hat and put money on my own head
i forever hear people talking like i dont know about street
fake gangstas must think i spent my music money on chocolate and sweets
youre looking for beef in london nah its not hard to find it
but im not scared of a gun its all about the man behind it
this famous life make people wanna wish they were 6 feet under
i just wish that i knew what i know now when i was younger
i dont wanna sit in the vip but sometimes i just wanna be left alone
i hate when im in a bad mood and i see all my supporters vibesn
and i apologies to anyone ive taking a pic with when i werent smiling
they say dont you remember me i met you at party in the park
babe i cant even where i parked my car in the car park
now she hates me and everytime she hears my song shes changing the station
i swear the human brain werent designed to deal with all this information
this famous life can make some people wish they were 6 feet under
you die before you live i wish you warned me when i started
cause now were 6 feet under the top spot fuck a casket
bastards dont we make the lifestyle look appealing
cause now im on the otherside of that glass ceiling
the games full of demons lets get this armhouse on
everyone wants handouts but i aint stretch armstrong
round of applause or bust it off just make it clap please
and i dont wanna act totally crazy so asta la vista baby
my phone asks me if im sure i wanna delete the number
now im on stage and i feel like im looking through michael jacksons eyes
stories rumours and accusations so i gotta stay self conscious of my hand gestures before they call me a mason or say that im working with satan
but even a blind man could see i would never sell my soul for the p
when youre looking at skepta youre looking at grime so the only thing i gotta stay true to is me
i dont need a helping hand stand up tall im my own man
find me on the tallest building in the country singing as loud as i can
its time to enjoy the sun cause we made it through the rain
put your hands up in the sky like youre tryna touch a plane
went triple platinum see me im trying to do what elvis done
labels never thought this guy from the ghetto could make all these girls sing for me
tell the bartender take a fat bottle of champagne to polydors table
so i pull down the two flaps on my cap cause i didnt want to hear that bullshit
then i pull out my card swipe it bowl out with 20 bags
if i like them cop them fuck the hater cant stop them
mcs wanna diss ndubz but they cant get a top twenty let alone a top ten
so if it werent for the fans i woulda had a haters blood on my hands
im a mastermind behind the keyboard so im a carry on stacking up these grands
you aint heard nothing like this so god forgive me
walked into the club and i got two sexy girls on each side
money in the bank but still i got to stay on my grind
and they told me to shut this down im a do it tonight
and i buy the things that you wanna buy yeah take that come on dont stop talk to em girl
so hot that i bring the shit m a say hello good morning
spending dirty money everywhere go from the 504 new york to london like diddy we get money the is acting funny
cause we jet set we taking all your milk and honey
then im going to rip him to shreds live on the stage like jeremy
you can tell by my accent that im straight out of london city
doing it again they tried to stop me but im doing it again
a lot of man never though i would get to say my piece
so im sitting up praying for success to come a little sooner
you would have thought that this was a reverse parking manoeuvre
and the question everyones asking is who are you
so i gotta put these squares in the right place like a rubiks cube
better remember when youre talking to a chart topper
yes london you know fish chips cup o tea bad food worse weather mary fucking poppins london
look a badboy straight in the face tell him im a real badboy fuck mike lowery

when i say that i stick it in the pussyole cause it aint no sexual innuendo
i been producing since mario came on the super nintendo

he got shot in the face lincoln i would have thought that was obvious
whatd you do that for you mistake him for a rabbit what do you want me to do about it
but you are a bad boy yardie and bad boy yardies are supposed to know how to get rid of bodies
there aint no clowns round here when i find one go to the circus

100 nightmares in my brain clearly tryna stop me sleeping
1000 diamonds in my chain and its hurting a lot of mans feelings
you wanna know why they call me guy fawkes in the club just look at my table

keep my mouth shut like winston and tracy fam  over my dead body
too much tv too many newspapers got a nigga thinking evil
got me thinking im looking at my enemy when im looking at my own people
notice when a white man looks at my watch i think hes trying to pay me a compliment
when a black man looks at my watch i think hes trying to knock my confidence mad
i was in amsterdam smoking blue cheese and i had an epiphany
all these negative preconceptions just bring more negativity
instead of investing in new businesses they buy new artillery
everybody in the hood wants to spray a 16 and i dont mean lyrically
underdog psychosis spreading around in the hood like flu
security guards follow me around like i aint got £2 to pay for my juice
now all this bullshit got me smoking this stupid zoot
tell boris hes lucky that i made it rapping or i wouldve been looting too
niggas aint got gcses still dont wanna work for a minimum wage
these days man will murder a man for a box of grade
every time the38 barrel spins martin luther turns in the grave
its real life no computer game were living in the streets of rage
they think i dont know that these niggas are dissing me
hating cause me and my brothers buss in the industry
but they dont say nothing when they see me in the street
niggas is bitches theyre showing their femininity
fuck the talking just plug in the fucking auxiliary
sexing her to death she screaming junior youre killing me
you might see me in south london buzzing in ministry
weapons in the car for man that wanna do it physically
came here with my pride and im a leave with my dignity
shes undressing me with her eyes shes stripping me
his and hers jordans looking like kanye and kimberley
been here already living we dont need to get a pass
you put that all aside and youre looking at two stars
tell man hold this two middle fingers up to the feds
im a free how can they say that im still on the gangland ting
but if i cant figure you out please you gotta go
put the pedal to the metal full throttle like woah
they thought the all over the house video would crush me
last week i did five shows in five different countries
i walk from white hart lane to the flats opposite tottenham police station
linked murkle man to make some more grime in the basement
blade long enough to go to jail for more dots on me than a dice
so it was just me my cats and the foxes roaming the streets at night
for one whole year never got music money or money off white
now me and jme top 30 back to back on the itunes site mental
for my niggas in the grave for my niggas in prison
let me tell you bout the last pagan that clowned about
thinking fuck the world cus im trynna cheat death
lightys wanna suck me but i only want the queens head
paralyzed on this green now i feel like a garden gnome
suffering from cannabis psychosis im in a crazy zone
blame that on the 22 000 voices in my millenium dome mental
celebrity ladies calling me daily but i dont answer the phone
she thinks im gonna buy her a diamond she better go to sierra leone
ill be sitting at home drinking this patrón until i get a kidney stone
mob til i die these bitches can suck my bone icy
break off a little chip of cigarette and mix it all up with the weed mmm
now i cant remember what were smoking is it the og kush or the cheese
all i know is it feels like the rooms spinning round at phenomenal speed mental
when we talk pussies dont answer back cause were some rhetorical gs
ive got niggas on standby waiting to make somebody bleed bo bo bo bo
man try take me for a lemon im a tell them i dare you to squeeze
next time you see me and my gang man wont be wearing boy better know tees
no more sleepless nights looking for the way to survive
but i simply cant afford to change it up change it up
yeah when i came in the game i kept my eyes wide open like fish in the sea
im done smiling with people i dont like in places i dont wanna be
she told me its just a little bit of powder so i look better in hd
i saw the video i had so much makeup i didnt even look like me

i would love you more if you brought me a packet of rizla and something to eat
i dont wanna hear your im not a groupie tell me your real name speech
my real name is skepta and i do this for my niggas that breach
i do this for the girl with green eyes sunbathing topless on a beach
i tell an ar come check me if you wanna talk about making an anthem
you wanna talk label politics go and check david cameron
cause if success is judged by chart positions and riches
ill put the mic down and leave my legacy to reign on all these bitches
but i still find that standing here watching you leave
and i lived like that for so long that it fucked with my head
but i simply cant afford to change it up change it up
she just wants to feel like shes alive so the doctors are making a killing
fighting and losing the battle against photoshop while the papers are winning
still no sign of the finishing line but way too far from the beginning
her body wasnt growing as fast as all the other girls in the school
she eventually started to catch feelings when everybody was hurling abuse
swerving the truth mums telling her shes killing her body but still
shes felt like the abuse has left more scars the any type of surgery will
now shes all grown up if only dad would of shown more love
then she wouldnt be seeking attention from all these other guys in the club
a good girl in a wrong dress confidence got taken away
now all shes left with is a complex another victim of a next sexual conquest
if theyre trying to sell an impossible dream to a fool
these pictures and publications have got people packing their bags for a journey that has no destination
pocket full of twenty pound notes she likes receiving and i like giving
so i just sit in my chair vision impaired shes kissing my ear
and ill probably say some hypocritical shit like whys a pretty lady like you gotta work in here
had this jamaican girl rubbing on my thigh i told her
shes fucking with the greatest rapper alive she gave me the heisman i said i was a pop star
if you know me eh a wat da bloodclart if you know me eh eh you know me
she is fucking with the greatest rapper alive she gave me the heisman and said i was a pop star
but dont try this at home this aint for beginners
so i dont know what are these niggas are watching me for
everybody runs stewie got a gun said she is ready to go
she wants me to come but ive already been give the drummer some
but the party aint done until they turn the lights on
whats poppin mans mans never been in marquee when its shutdown eh trust me daddy
a bunch of young men all dressed in black dancing extremely aggressively on stage
it made me feel so intimidated and its just not what i expect to see on prime time tv
yo tomorrow im gonna come scoop you well go to bizs

big fekky and skepta what the fuck are they gonna say to us

cant wait til the day til i sit here and say we made it way too much
one more bottle imma drop my brother im faded im faded

i was out here repping my ends and you was in bed by ten

they thought the all over the house video would crush me
now me and jme top 30 back to back on the itunes site mental
it aint safe for the block not even for the cops
niggas wanna kill me tell them go and get your uzi
still you can end up dead when you disrespect the goonies
smokin on some indo looking for the police through the window
never disturb a baker when hes mixing up the flour
but when you see my niggas you look like you see a ghost
these niggas follow fashion dont look comfy in their clothes
see them on the roads getting lovey dovey with the hoes
ill put you in your place forreal you disrespect the clique
from soho to the heights theyre fuckin with me heavy
they know me and my gang were the realest on the telly
that i cant really hear what the people are saying
and they telling me to tell you to stay in your lane
lord of the mics fam i could have clashed any man
and you would get a wun mai long son den some win seng
and when you talk about 0121 i know some serious people
did a youtube video none of your guys in the back ever showed their faces
cause they know devilman did snitch on some serious cases
them man cant say anything that i aint already told man about my life
talk about music me and my bros are killing it all over the globe
now your angry cause everyone on your road is asking for me like the wifi code

thats why im in paris taking pics with the girls outside on the streets
there will never be another like me rep my gang til i die
im gonna smoke my spliff til it gets to the roach and it burns my fingers
picture me broke in the hood on the run from the police up to no good
driving with no license two packs in the passenger seat looking like suge
fuck that ive gotta get paid i swear im tryna be the hustler of the year
ive been killing it for lots of years put money on my head thats stocks and shares

and now i got these hoes on my iphone talkin bout hey stranger

and like lukey said trust me failures not an option
treatin shows of 25 people the same as 25 thousand
thats why im on a worldwide tour and i aint even dropped my album
i had a strap on my lap thinkin about enemies i wanna put one in
ive got girls down under tellin me that im on triple j
come off my tv all they do is stand up and pose like mannequins
i put my voting card in a black bin and i dash that like javelin
in the studio run out of drink all we got is some weed and biscuits
instead im daydreaming about doggystyling kate winslet
tryna think about punchlines that i havent already said
i wanna write a diss track but my enemies are already dead
i only smoke one spliff but my eyes are already red
for man to offer me a biscuit cos i dont normally beg
open up the pizza box we got earlier but its full of crust and corn
these other mcs remind me of mr bean and johnny english reborn
thats where i fucked up them pussyholes when they tried to pop my chain
if you put it on me you better put something over your face
cos i wont snitch ill tell the officer i dont wanna press no charges
go home and deal with the beef like sunday roast on a plate
where the olders talk but the youngers aint listening
i was given dirty looks by the priest at my christening
and i get so much cake i might change my surname to kipling
said ill be a big mc by end of school term and they thought i was joking
now i got 15 girls in my bed and each and every one of thems roasting
i cry tears in my cup of hennessey for these fucked up memories
i cut niggas off for them bad vibes and them fucked up energies
shouts to the niggas that dont like me shout out to the ones that are reppin me
shout out the niggas that tried to finesse me but im too plugged in mentally
heard that wasteman taking shots but hes just a wannabee rooney
your life is like a talk show trust me that aint no movie
never ever gonna be a top boy never ever gonna be lukey
he said skepta next year dont wanna see any of the mandem on the block
said that hes gonna make me proud tracksuit mafia straight to the top
said when the money comes in then all of the mandem are setting up shop
you told me man are gonna be smiling told me champagne gonna pop
i can hear your voice in my head like skeppy keep moving forward
you shutdown from texas to norwood stay low key stay ghost
like patrick swayze and demi moore would dont watch them mans corners
do what you want and say what you feel dont care if it makes things awkward
supposed to be grieving but instead im in the hood with the whole team scheming
supposed to be leaving but i stay right here cause my heart still bleeding
i know that we aint been eating and i know that we aint been sleeping
but whatever mum wants thats what mum gets everybody better put their ps in
man are gonna pay by cash yes man are gonna pay by card
cause i know that if it was one of us trust me lukey would have gone hard
so many wreaths of flowers i look to the sky man i need some powers
cause i feel like times running out man i need more hours

dont believe what youre seein on the tv channels please
still they aint send me an award to put on the mantelpiece
the girls still wanna come to the house and get frisky
woke up early tryin to catch the worm in the big apple
only had enough cash for a pink snapple if i got thirsty

when my mandem pop it off your manna will fly into the sky like easyjet
shaking the petrol pump tryna get the last bits of petrol
i think im the best and i call it competitive confidence not vanity
its not my fault them man got a childish mentality
they dont know how to make a tune for the mainstream
watch what too many man and sunglasses at night do in 2009
i write that classical line to last me my whole life time
then skepta comes around with a flow that breaks down
to book skepta aint getting no cheaper promoters still want me to feature
youre sitting at home telling yourself the swag food youre smoking is a creeper
if im danger turn into a gymnastic with a little linford christie
and boy better know the difference between sending for the 9 millimetre and a murderer
cause im so presidential and these yutes aint respecting the president
now your thinking this grime ting aint the in ting

ill always try and stop you tripping but its awkward if you slipping up yourself i aint perfect though
looking for what i dont know in the end its all worthless

5am and i cant sleep its been the same for the past week
ive been up from morning my daughters clogged up

reality check yo i just wanna do my thing and avoid all things that cant help me if i didnt have another hit song the label woulda probably shelf me in this current climate i can tell u that aint healthy thats why i ball out living wealthy but i aint gonna do that cause u tell me

i go macho on people eediat tunes cause really wiley goes in
im torn between catering for me and the fans im going mad
i only hear my big hits where people go to get tans beach

for the wayward music they want brother i dont want mils
when i spit spit to kill not only fruity loops that i kill
had em scared and shook like i just got signed and dropped let go from the deal
but its still bless cause he knows where the vibe is
i cant get it any more thats a sign of the times though

from a place where your big bad brother cant save you
where the olders are washed and the young gs out on the block who want grief

thats askin a lot when im fair on the pitch passing a lot
i got quite sick of opinions rise above now im laughing a lot
